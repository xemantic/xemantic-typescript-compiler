# A checklist for adjustments after staring new project out of this template

> [!NOTE]
> When going through these files, remember to not only perform a change, but also remove the `TODO` comments.

* [ ] Change project name in [settings.gradle.kts](settings.gradle.kts).
* [ ] Adjust [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) if needed.
* [ ] Check the license, if Apache 2.0 is not the license you intended, then replace it in:
  * [LICENSE](LICENSE)
  * [.idea/copyright](.idea/copyright) folder (it is easier to edit it through IDEA settings)
* [ ] Update [README.md](README.md) with the description and rationale behind your project. Remove irrelevant part focused on the template project.
* [ ] Go through [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts) and fix all the TODOs.
* [ ] Delete this `CHECKLIST.md` file

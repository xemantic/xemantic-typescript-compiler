# CLAUDE.md

This file captures only what cannot be inferred from the codebase itself.

## Rules for editing this file

Both developers and AI agents are expected to add entries as they encounter surprises.

- **Add an entry** when you encounter something unexpected: a build quirk, a non-obvious constraint, a dependency gotcha, or any behavior that would surprise the next agent or developer.
- **Add an entry** when a developer flags an anti-pattern produced by AI — describe the anti-pattern and the preferred alternative.
- **Do not** add codebase overviews, directory listings, or anything discoverable by reading the source.
- Keep entries concise: one line per lesson, grouped under a heading if a theme emerges.

## Known gotchas

- `project.exec {}` is not available in Gradle 9 Kotlin DSL task `doLast` blocks — use `ProcessBuilder` directly instead.
- TypeScript compiler tests are **generated** by `./gradlew generateTypeScriptTests` into `build/generated/typescript-tests/`; this task requires the TypeScript repo to be cloned first (done automatically via `cloneTypeScriptRepo` dependency). Never edit generated files manually.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Do not add content to this file that is already discoverable by reading the source or build scripts — that inflates context without adding signal, reducing AI agent task success rates (see [arxiv 2602.11988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988)).

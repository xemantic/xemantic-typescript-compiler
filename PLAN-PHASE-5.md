# PLAN-PHASE-5 — Self-compile the TypeScript compiler, then performance

Owner directive (2026-07-03, re-scoping the 2026-07-02 *"fully compile any TypeScript
project"*): **fully compile the TypeScript compiler itself, then optimize
performance.** "Any TypeScript project" is the post-v1 horizon.

**v1 definition of done:** all 8 tsc-source profiles (compiler / tsc-cli / jsTyping /
deprecatedCompat / typingsInstallerCore / services / server / harness) at **zero false
positives**, all files emitted, zero crashes/hangs/OOMs — verifiable fully offline.
Byte-correct emit diffing against real tsc is the network-gated follow-up (needs
node + typescript installed). Then M5 (performance) completes the directive. Items
that do not block v1 (M2.4, M3.0, M3.5, all of M4) are parked in § "Post-v1 backlog"
near the bottom of this file — the top-to-bottom loop skips them until v1 lands.

This file is the **live queue** for Phase 17. `PLAN-PHASE-4.md` (Phase 16 and earlier)
is archived state — its "Known architectural blockers" section remains the reference
material for the M3 items below; do not work its queue.

## Phase 17 — Self-compile the TypeScript compiler (M0–M5)

(Live session notes accumulate here, most recent first — same convention as Phase 16.)

**Round 587 (2026-07-18) — dead-marks sweep + the retirement's measured
payoff.** The 52 legacy-side truncation-mark lines (the emit-twice-era
`cpaM3Mk`/`ctaM3EmitMark`/… val+truncate blocks in the surviving walkers)
are deleted — provably dead since rounds 585/586 (only the retired drivers
reached marked statements; anchor walks reach only never-marked nested
positions). The m3l body gates + the marking sets stay (live: the
decl-leave recording skip and the m3e recordOnly gating). MEASURED (CI
bench, single-run caveat): the cpa retirement alone moved the compiler
profile 35.67s → 30.79s wall (−14%); the cta-retire row lands next.
Gates: corpus 11,341/0; listAll ×8 identical. NEXT: the g3
(checkCallExpressionTypes) migration — the LAST giant — via the
twice-proven m1..m3+retire sequence (open with the walker state-model
scout in a fresh window).

**Round 586 (2026-07-18) — (cta-retire) LANDED: the checkTypeAssignability
LEGACY PASS IS RETIRED — both migrated giants are off emit-twice in one
day.** Same shape as round 585: the experiment's only failures were the
cta audit scaffolding's own tests; the pass dispatch + driver +
ctaAuditLegacy/ctaAuditSpine/ctaAuditEnabled + the fingerprint fns +
Inv4CtaAuditTest are deleted (−5 tests; CtaFnBodyAnchorTest + the corpus
remain the guards). The cta/cpa m3 truncation marks in the surviving
walkers are dead code (only the retired drivers reached marked
statements) — queued for a cleanup sweep with a listAll gate. Gates:
corpus 11,341/0 (447 XMLs); listAll ×8 byte-identical. Wall-time deltas
land via the CI bench rows for rounds 585/586. NEXT: the g3
(checkCallExpressionTypes) migration (m1..m3 + retire — the last giant),
or the dead-marks cleanup sweep.

**Round 585 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-retire) LANDED: THE checkPropertyAccess
LEGACY PASS IS RETIRED — the first giant sheds its emit-twice runs.** The
`pass("checkPropertyAccess")` dispatch is gone; every cpa emission runs
once, from the spine anchors, and the walkers live on as anchor-called
leaf machinery. The retirement experiment's ONLY failures were the audit
scaffolding's own tests (no legacy side left to diff — by design), so the
scaffolding is deleted with it: cpaAuditLegacy/cpaAuditSpine/
cpaAuditEnabled, the fingerprint fns, the nearest-anchored symmetric-skip
helper, and Inv4CpaAuditTest (−7 tests; its verification job — the m2
skeleton parity — is complete and historical; CpaAnchorTest + the corpus
remain the behavior guards). The legacy-side truncation marks (cpaM3Mk
blocks) are now provably dead (only the retired driver reached marked
statements; anchor walks reach only never-marked nested positions) — left
in place, queued for a cleanup sweep. Gates: corpus 11,346/0 (448 XMLs);
listAll ×8 byte-identical. The wall-time delta lands via the CI bench.
NEXT: the g3 (checkCallExpressionTypes) migration via the same m1..m3
sequence — its residue channel is already closed (round 584) — or the
cta-retire evaluation (cta's consumer was cpa, now spine-fed; the cta
emit-twice runs' remaining consumers need the same experiment).

**Round 584 (2026-07-18) — (ccet-prep) LANDED: the cpa→ccet residue channel
is closed — ZERO couplings.** checkCallExpressionTypes' driver resets
`currentLocalTypes` per file (it previously inherited the cpa pass's
LAST-file map as its starting state — the round-578 pattern, one giant
downstream). Measured: corpus 11,353/0 AND listAll ×8 byte-identical with
NO own-recording needed (unlike the cta→cpa channel's one corpus shape).
This is the cpa-retire prerequisite: with ccet residue-free, the cpa
legacy emit-twice runs' only remaining consumer is the cpa pass itself.
NEXT: the (cpa-retire) EXPERIMENT — no-op the legacy checkPropertyAccess
dispatch and gate; if identical, delete the legacy runs + the audit
scaffolding (CpaAnchorTest + the corpus remain the guards) and re-measure
the wall-time win.

**Round 583 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m3c) LANDED: heritage + property-initializer
walks join the anchor — the cpa statement-DISPATCH emission surface is
fully anchored.** A ClassDECLARATION's heritage expressions anchor at the
heritage EXPRESSION node's leave with the OUTER ect (legacy walks them
before the classType resolution; member walks don't mutate the shared
maps, so the class-position frame state is correct); member
PropertyDeclaration initializers anchor at the member's leave with the
member-loop ambient (cpaResolveClassType + per-member inStatic) installed
locally (the cta-m3k pattern). ClassExpression heritage/members stay owned
by the containing statement's anchor (pinned). Legacy marks: per-EWTA in
the ClassDeclaration arm; the shared member dispatch's PropertyDeclaration
arm (safe — ClassExpression members are never marked). GATE-PROCESS NOTE:
the first gate chain's suite run FAILED silently (gradle daemon crash) and
the verify script counted 43 STALE XMLs as "passing" — caught by the
xml-file-count sanity check; the fresh `rm -rf build/test-results/jvmTest`
rerun is the true gate (the background-task-verification memory hazard,
now with the file-count guard in the verify snippet). Pins +2
(CpaAnchorTest → 11). Gates: corpus 11,353/0 (449 XMLs); listAll ×8
identical. Remaining legacy-owned cpa emissions: NONE at the statement
dispatch — the emit-twice runs persist only for map evolution. NEXT:
(cpa-retire) evaluate retiring the legacy emit-twice runs for cpa (the
frames reproduce all map evolution; the residue channel is closed), or
pivot to g3 (checkCallExpressionTypes) via the same m1..m3 sequence.

**Round 582 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m3b) LANDED first-try: the remaining
statement arms' direct walks join the anchor.** Condition/subject/
incrementor/case-expr walks anchor at the EXPRESSION node's OWN leave —
after its subtree (probe-safe: the diagnostics-list probes see the
subtree's spine emissions) and BEFORE the owner's body statements
(state-correct: the legacy walk ran these before the body dispatch, whose
recordings leak into the shared maps); the If/While/Do/For/Switch/With
legacy arms truncate per-walk via marks keyed on the EXPRESSION node.
Throw/ExportAssignment/TypeAliasDeclaration (the strictNullChecks-gated
walkTypeNodeForUndefinedTypeQueryChain) and EnumDeclaration (member
initializers under a currentEnclosingEnum install) anchor at the
statement's leave with whole-arm truncation. Statements inside
condition-nested arrow bodies stay owned by the condition anchor's walk
(the forAnchor chain rejects them — the double-emit control pinned by the
arrow-in-condition test). Pins +3 (CpaAnchorTest → 9). Gates: corpus
11,351/0; listAll ×8 identical. The cpa statement-DISPATCH emission
surface is now anchored except: class HERITAGE walks + member
PropertyDeclaration initializer walks (the ClassDeclaration arm), and the
B1.3 walkTypeNode inside... (TypeAlias done); NEXT: (cpa-m3c) the
ClassDeclaration arm's heritage + property-initializer walks, then the
emit-twice retirement question for cpa (cheaper than cta's: the legacy
arms' only residual value is map evolution the frames already reproduce).

**Round 581 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m3a) LANDED: THE FIRST cpa EMISSIONS RUN
FROM THE SPINE — frames always-on.** Var/Expr/Return statements' DIRECT
expression walks dispatch from the spine anchor under the frame ambient
(the walk IS the legacy expr walker, so nested arrow/fn-expr/class-expr
bodies emit as part of it — the ANCHOR chain variant (`forAnchor`) rejects
those crossings to prevent double-anchoring; the cta
walkFunctionBodiesInExpr precedent); the legacy arms truncate via the
recorded set. Var anchors run walk+record INTERLEAVED per decl (the legacy
order); the decl-leave recording path serves the remaining non-anchored
chains; audit fingerprints skip statements under anchored statements
SYMMETRICALLY (the anchor's walk owns their context, not the frames).
THREE quirks extracted by the gates: (1) `inStaticClassMethod` must be
INSTALLED in the emission ambient (a FIELD the emitters consult — 8
class-family corpus failures); (2) the anchor dispatches at the statement's
LEAVE, never its enter — cpa emitters PROBE the diagnostics list for the
subtree's own spine emissions (the ures TS2304 suppressing
checkSingleElementAccess's TS2538 — the round-537 lesson recurs); (3)
`cpaResolveClassType` installs the lexical tables (a BLOCK-level class's
class+interface merge resolves via lexicalScopeSymbol — the Inv2 pilot
pin caught the null-ambient miss). Pins +6 (CpaAnchorTest: exactly-once
across top-level/ns/if/switch/arrow/fn-expr/method/this scopes + negative
control). Gates: corpus 11,348/0; listAll ×8 identical. NEXT: (cpa-m3b)
the remaining statement arms' direct walks (If/While/Do/For conditions,
Switch subject+case exprs, Throw/With/ExportAssignment, TypeAlias's
walkTypeNodeForUndefinedTypeQueryChain, Enum member initializers with
currentEnclosingEnum) — then the class-member / heritage arms.

**Round 580 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m2b) LANDED: tier 2 completes the cpa frame
skeleton — 7/7 audit-green on the FIRST run (the round-579b design scout
paid off).** The chain test became a unified per-EDGE reach walker
(statement + expression edges with the legacy walkers' per-arm precision:
TaggedTemplate tag-only, for-INIT / ForIn-ForOf iterables / decorators /
objlit methods / shorthand / CommaList / param defaults fail closed);
arrow Block-body frames (3-map copy, populate → shadowing/ambiguous → ctx
param registration, ect/inStatic preserved) and fn-expr body frames (the
OWN param loop: annotated → set, UN-annotated → REMOVE + destructured-name
collection; ctx registration BEFORE shadowing — the asymmetric legacy
orders; ect = null) replace the marker frames; class-member frames extend
to ClassExpression owners via the per-visit synthetic anon-class type;
`cpaCtxAt` pull-derives contextualType over the ctx edges (DEFINE at
call-arg via the extracted-and-SHARED `cpaComputeArgCtxTypes` /
objlit-prop / spread / arrow-expr-body; INHERIT through New's args and a
Call's callee — the legacy quirks; STOP-null at statements), computed
UNDER THE TOP AMBIENT BEFORE the frame push (cpaFrames.last() supplies the
classType at the fn's own position); `cpaEctAt` handles the two
ect-changing pure-expression edges (class-member PropertyDeclaration
initializers; ClassExpression heritage → null vs ClassDeclaration heritage
→ outer). The audit now asserts FULL BIDIRECTIONAL key equality
(mismatches empty + legacy-only empty). Pins +1 net (Inv4CpaAuditTest → 7,
two rewritten). Gates: corpus 11,342/0; listAll ×8 identical (flag off in
production). NEXT: (cpa-m3) emission moves scope-by-scope with the
recorded-set truncation template — the audit skeleton is the always-on
frame base once the first emission moves.

**Round 579 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m2a) LANDED: the SPINE-side statement-TIER
frame skeleton for the g2 migration, audit-verified.** Dead machinery under
`cpaAuditEnabled`: `CpaFrame`s reproduce the legacy cpa dispatchers'
context — map COPIES only at function-like boundaries with the per-member-kind
asymmetries (fn-decl: 4 maps + populate/shadowing/ambiguous, enumParams
REPLACED via collectEnumConstrainedParams; method/ctor: 3 maps, enumParams
SHARED, + populate/shadowing, method this-param override resolved under the
CLASS-level ambient; setter: 2 maps (shadowed shared), populate only;
getter: NO copies), ModuleBlock ns frames with the legacy nested-vs-top
resolution split (dotted-namespace inners are legacy-UNREACHED — the arm
walks only ModuleBlock bodies), ForIn/ForOf loop-var overrides applied at
the BODY node's enter and restored at its leave, and the VariableStatement
B136/B186 recordings applied at each VariableDeclaration's LEAVE (so a
nested arrow body in decl k+1 sees only decls 1..k). `withCpaFrameAmbient`
installs the frame maps + the frame-reproduced `propertyAccessEnclosingNamespaces`
(the two-stacks bridging in populateParameterLocalTypes consults the REAL
deque) + checkFileName/flowGraph. QUIRK EXTRACTED by the first audit cycle:
a TryStatement's/CatchClause's own Blocks are reached via their statement
LISTS, never dispatched AS statements, and a catch VariableDeclaration (a
Statement subtype!) is never dispatched — the fingerprint gate needs the
`cpaM2StmtPosition` immediate-position test alongside the chain test.
Fingerprints agree on the widened fixtures (fns/classes incl. this-param
methods + static/getter/setter/ctor, namespaces + nested + classes-in-ns,
loops incl. for-in/for-of, switch/try/label, element-access + call-chain
recordings); tier-2 chains (arrow/fn-expr bodies) stay spine-excluded.
Pins +2 (Inv4CpaAuditTest → 6). Gates: corpus 11,341/0; listAll ×8
identical (flag off in production). NEXT: (cpa-m2b) tier 2 — arrow/fn-expr
body frames + the contextualType downward channel (call-arg /
objlit-property / arrow-body edges, the w3 template) + objlit-method /
class-expression bodies.

**Round 578 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m2-prep) LANDED: the cta→cpa RESIDUE CHANNEL
IS CLOSED — checkPropertyAccess is now per-file self-sufficient.** The cpa
driver resets `currentLocalTypes` per file (it previously started from the
cta pass's LAST-file residue and accumulated its own map across files —
backward pass-after-pass reads a spine migration cannot reproduce, the
round-542/559 finding). The experiment isolated the dependence to EXACTLY
ONE corpus shape (noImplicitAnyForIn — round 542's prediction confirmed:
`var k1 = x[i]`'s `{}` receiver type came from cta's un-annotated var
recording); replaced by the pass's OWN recording — the B136 branch now also
accepts ElementAccessExpression initializers under the same concreteness
gates. Measured: corpus 11,339/0 AND listAll ×8 byte-identical — the
residue fed NOTHING on the real tsc sources. This unblocks BOTH (cpa-m2)
(frames can reproduce per-file state — no backward reads) and (cta-retire)
(cpa no longer consumes cta's map evolution). NEXT: (cpa-m2) the spine-side
frame skeleton — state model scouted in-code this round: fn-decl bodies
copy 4 maps (+ shadowing + ambiguous, ect=null), method/ctor bodies copy 3
(no enumParams, + shadowing), setters copy 2 (no shadowed, no shadowing
call), getters copy NOTHING; ForIn/ForOf override the loop var around the
body only (ForOf's elemType from getTypeOfExpression, Array/string only);
the ns stack pushes at non-declare ModuleDeclarations with a nested-vs-top
resolution split; VariableStatement B136/B186 recordings apply per-decl
AFTER that decl's initializer walk (spine: at the VariableDeclaration's
LEAVE, so nested arrow-body fingerprints see only PRIOR decls' recordings);
arrows/fn-exprs copy 3 maps + contextual param registration gated on the
downward contextualType channel (call-arg / objlit-property / arrow-body
edges — the w3 template).**

**Round 577 (2026-07-18) — (cpa-m1) LANDED: the g2 (checkPropertyAccess)
migration opens with the legacy-side audit instrumentation.** Mirrors
cta-m2a: under the test-only `cpaAuditEnabled`, `checkPropertyAccessInStatement`
records a per-DIRECT-statement fingerprint keyed by nodeId into
`cpaAuditLegacy` — channels: currentLocalTypes (by DISPLAY via typeToString,
never Type.id — ids are resolution-order-sensitive between legacy-time and
spine-time), currentParamBindingNames, currentEnumConstrainedParams,
currentShadowedNames, propertyAccessEnclosingNamespaces (name stack),
enclosingClassType (threaded param, by display), contextualType,
inStaticClassMethod. Pins +4 (Inv4CpaAuditTest: coverage + annotated-param
lt[] content + class ect=/static-flag + namespace ns[] stack +
off-by-default). Gates: corpus 11,339/0; listAll ×8 identical (flag off in
production — pure scaffolding). NEXT: (cpa-m2) the spine-side frame
skeleton audited against this map (expect quirk-extraction cycles; the
known quirks are listed in the queue item).

**Round 576 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3m) LANDED: the checkFunctionBody param-loop
emission joins the anchor — the cta giant's EMISSION surface is complete
across reproduced scopes.** The 16.4ei destructuring-from-nullable-union
param emission anchors INSIDE the ctaFnBodyFrame sandwich at its exact
legacy position (after shadowing, under the TP scope, BEFORE param typing —
the m2d emissions-first order), with the anchor ambient installed around
the loop only — currentFlowGraph is MANDATORY there (a null graph loses the
round-425 narrowing suppression and would OVER-emit vs legacy);
currentScopeStatements installs the fn's ENCLOSING list (the legacy value
at that point — the body's own InStatements has not yet run). The legacy
loop skips via the m3l recorded set; eligibility is ONE predicate
(`ctaM3BodyWalkersEligible`) shared by the m3l Block dispatch, the sandwich
emission, and (via the recorded set) all three legacy gates. Also removed
the three dead ctaM3P/ctaM3Parent vars (m3h0 residue — restores the
warning-clean build). Pins +3 (fn + method exactly-once, non-nullable
negative control, block-bodied-arrow reach control — an EXPRESSION-bodied
arrow never routes through checkFunctionBody, so its param defaults draw
nothing on any path; the first pin cut used one and read a false 0). Gates:
corpus 11,335/0; listAll ×8 identical vs 574c. Remaining legacy-owned in
the giant: the emit-twice map-evolution runs only. NEXT: legacy-arm
RETIREMENT for fully-covered scopes (the multiplier payoff) or the
INV.4(e) pivot to g2 (checkPropertyAccess).

**Round 575 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3l) LANDED: the checkFunctionBody BODY-LEVEL
walkers join the anchor + a latent reach over-shoot closed.** The B442
for-in/numeric-for redeclare + B205 FlatArray depth-param walkers
(ambient-independent AST scans at checkFunctionBody entry) dispatch at
eligible body-Block spine enters (FunctionDeclaration + class
Method/GetAccessor owners — ctor/SetAccessor bodies never route through
checkFunctionBody, and the GetAccessor arm mirrors legacy's
emptyList()/null so FlatArray stays a no-op there; objlit/arrow/fn-expr
bodies stay owned by their containing statement's emit-twice); the legacy
pair skips via the recorded set keyed on the body Block's nodeId (B205 has
no internal dedup — the FlatArray pin is the sharp double-emit signal;
B442's forInNumForProcessed dedup would mask one). REACH FIX: `ctaM3FnHop`
now requires a statement-LIST landing — the bare InStmt dispatcher has NO
FunctionDeclaration/ClassDeclaration arm (`else -> {}`), so a fn/class at a
bare if-then/loop-body/labeled position is UNREACHED by the legacy giant;
since m3d the chain test crossed those positions freely — a latent spine
over-reach invisible to every gate (the shape is absent from the corpus and
the tsc sources), now pinned by the bare-position parity test. Pins +5
(CtaFnBodyAnchorTest → 22). Gates: corpus 11,332/0; listAll ×8 identical
vs the 568a chain. Remaining legacy-owned in the giant: the
ctor/getter/setter/method dispatch shells' non-statement bits and the
emit-twice map-evolution runs. NEXT: the INV.4(e) pivot (g2
checkPropertyAccess per the g1 playbook) or legacy-arm retirement for
fully-covered scopes.

**Round 574b (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3k) LANDED: class property initializers
join the anchor.** checkPropertyInitAssignability dispatches at the
PropertyDeclaration's spine enter (the anchor generalizes to Node; the
member-loop ambient — classForThis, class TP decls, classTypeParams —
installs locally over the enclosing frame); the legacy member arm truncates
via the recorded set. Pin +1 (instance + static, probe-verified firing).
Gates: corpus 11,327/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3j. Remaining
legacy-owned in the giant: the checkFunctionBody body-level walkers
(checkForInNumericForRedeclare, checkFlatArrayDepthParamAssignments), the
ctor/getter/setter/method dispatch shells' non-statement bits, and the
emit-twice map-evolution runs. NEXT: those body-level walkers (small), or
the INV.4(e) pivot to the other two giants.

**Round 574 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3j) LANDED: the B417 if-condition TS2367
joins the anchor — EVERY per-statement emission of the legacy assignability
dispatchers is now spine-anchored across the reproduced scopes.**
checkFlowNoOverlapCondition dispatches at the IfStatement's spine enter
(identical in both legacy arms → one anchor arm ahead of the surface
split); both legacy sites truncate via the recorded set; else-if and
narrowing-frame-nested ifs get the correct ambient by construction.
Exactly-once pinned by the corpus (test3 baseline). Gates: corpus
11,326/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3i. Remaining legacy-owned in the
giant: body-level walkers (checkForInNumericForRedeclare,
checkFlatArrayDepthParamAssignments), class PropertyDeclaration
initializers, the map-evolution re-runs (emit-twice, measured noise), and
the JS-gated objlit-method walker (a different pass). NEXT: those
body-level/member arms, or pivot back to the INV.4(e) giant-migration
proper (the spine dispatch of the remaining giants' walks) — the cta
emission surface is essentially complete.

**Round 573b (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3i) LANDED: narrowed regions anchored via
NARROWING FRAMES; the discard machinery retires; a SECOND round-570
order-dependence channel closed.** The legacy narrowing wrapper is a frame:
verdict at the If's enter (exact under frame maps, nested ifs included),
then-node pushes localTypes-copy + write + narrowedDeclared entry (new
CtaFrame field, installed by withCtaFrameLocals); the copy IS the discard
semantics → recordings + emissions inside narrowed regions correct for
free; ctaM3DiscardThen/Depth DELETED. The gate caught one drift
(tsbuildPublic bare-T TS2322), probe-root-caused: the un-annotated VAR-DECL
recording channel registered a FOREIGN-TP-carrying inferred type under
cold spine resolution (`packageJsonLookups && forEachKey(...)` →
`T | undefined` → narrowed to bare T → FP) — fixed at the source with the
B136 concreteness gate `!typeContainsForeignTypeParam(inferred,
typeParams)` (own TPs stay recordable). The narrowed-display pin now
guards the frame write; a nested-if pin verifies verdict exactness.
Gates: corpus 11,326/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3h1. The anchored surface
now includes narrowed regions — remaining legacy-owned in the assignability
giant: arrows/fn-exprs/objlit-method bodies, checkFlowNoOverlapCondition,
PropertyDeclaration initializers, and the wrapper's own map evolution.
NEXT: legacy-arm RETIREMENT for fully-covered scopes (the multiplier
payoff), or the remaining walkFunctionBodiesInExpr-owned bodies.

**Round 573 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3h1) LANDED: nested-position emissions join
the anchor.** Var/Expr/Return statements at nested positions anchor when
`ctaM3DiscardDepth == 0` and `ctaM3NestedChainOk` (statement Blocks /
clauses / bare if-loop-try-catch-labeled positions / fn hops). TWO legacy
arm surfaces reproduced by position kind: LIST positions get the full
InStatements surface, BARE positions the REDUCED InStmt surface
(`bareSurface` — no walkFunctionBodiesInExpr / const-literal registration /
return-expr B127), with currentScopeStatements = the nearest enclosing
list. The InStmt arms gained marks via the m3h0 recorded set. Narrowed
then-branches stay legacy-owned — pinned by the SHARP narrowed-display
test ('string' vs 'string | undefined'). With m3e recordings + m3h1, the
assignability giant's Var/Expr/Return emissions are now spine-anchored
across ALL reproduced scopes; remaining legacy-owned: narrowed-region
statements, arrows/fn-exprs/objlit-method bodies, checkFlowNoOverlapCondition
at if-conditions, and the non-stmt arms (class member loops etc.). Gates:
corpus 11,325/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3h0 — clean on the FIRST full
run. NEXT: narrowed-region anchoring (reproduce the narrowing WRITE in a
copied-map frame at then enters) — after which the emit-twice legacy runs
for these arms can start RETIRING (the multiplier payoff).

**Round 572b (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3h0) LANDED: the legacy truncation marks
consult the spine's RECORDED anchor set.** The spine records every anchored
statement's nodeId per file (`ctaM3AnchoredStmts`); the three legacy mark
gates test membership instead of re-deriving eligibility — gate identity by
CONSTRUCTION, freeing the spine-side eligibility to use spine-only state
(discard depth, frame context) in the nested-scope extension without a
legacy-side mirror. Also corrected-by-vacuity: the marks no longer fire for
.d.ts statements the spine never anchors (the landed m3a asymmetry). Pure
refactor: corpus 11,323/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3g. NEXT: (cta-m3h1)
extend spine anchoring through NON-narrowing nested chain positions
(statement Blocks / clauses / bare if-else-loop-try positions, gated
`ctaM3DiscardDepth == 0` at dispatch) + marks in checkTypeAssignabilityInStmt's
Var/Expr/Return arms via the recorded set; narrowed-region anchoring (the
narrowing-write reproduction) comes after.

**Round 572 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3g) LANDED: ctor + accessor bodies complete
the CLASS-MEMBER tier.** All four class-member body kinds are
anchor-eligible (`ctaM3FnHop`); each frame reproduces its legacy arm:
Constructor (raw InStatements dispatch) seeds frame.localTypes with the
this.$prop RESOLVED types + annotated params (`ctaFnBodyFrame(seedClass)`);
SetAccessor adds the B63.5 PARAM bridging (`paramTypeFallback` = paired
getter's return annotation, in BOTH the string map and the seeds);
GetAccessor (sandwich path) takes emptyList() params + the B63.5 RETURN
bridging (effective returnTypeNode = own ?: paired setter's param);
all three: class-TPs-only typeParams override + classForThis threading.
Pins +3 (ctor param mismatch / setter param mismatch / bridged
getter-return), each exactly-once. Gates: corpus 11,323/0; listAll ×8
identical vs m3f. The cta anchored surface now covers: top-level, namespace
bodies, FunctionDeclaration-chain fn bodies, and ALL ClassDeclaration
member bodies — remaining legacy-owned: objlit methods
(walkObjectLiteralMemberBody), arrows/fn-exprs (owned by the containing
statement's walkFunctionBodiesInExpr), and nested-scope statement kinds
(If/Switch/loop/Try arms' own emissions, e.g. checkFlowNoOverlapCondition).
NEXT: nested stmt-kind arm emissions, or begin RETIRING the legacy arms
where the anchor now owns everything (flip emit-twice to spine-only for the
covered scopes — the multiplier payoff).

**Round 571b (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3f) LANDED: CLASS METHOD bodies join the
anchor-eligible chains; m3e cost A/B'd as NOISE.** `ctaM3FnHop` extends the
eligibility chain (Block → MethodDeclaration → ClassDeclaration → the
statement-list chain; objlit methods/ctors/accessors stay legacy-owned).
The method frame reproduces the ClassDeclaration-arm quirks: typeParams =
class TPs + own ONLY (the legacy arm DROPS the enclosing scope's set via
outerTypeParams=classTypeParams — `ctaFnBodyFrame(outerTpNames)`), TP decls
accumulate normally, `CtaFrame.classForThis` threads per instance/static
into the anchor ambient (replacing the unconditional B101 null). Pin
lesson: the B101 void-this check requires a return-ANNOTATION-FREE method
(`m.type != null` bails) — the first pin shape was wrong, probe-verified on
both builds before blaming the threading (and a `cmd | grep | head && next`
chain SWALLOWS the test failure — the pipeline exit is head's). ALSO: the
m3e recordOnly cost measured by interleaved A/B (3 m3d/m3e pairs, both
class dirs kept): medians 44,424 vs 44,108 ms = −0.7%, NOISE — the
single-run bench spread was box drift per the interleave gotcha; no perf
promotion. Gates: corpus 11,320/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3e. NEXT:
GetAccessor bodies (needs the B63.5 paired-setter return bridging in the
frame), ctor/SetAccessor bodies (the currentLocalTypes this.X/param
seeding), or the nested stmt-kind arms.

**Round 571 (2026-07-18) — (cta-m3e) LANDED: anchor-SIMPLE lifted — the
legacy nested-dispatch recordings are reproduced spine-side.** A NON-anchored
VariableStatement's spine enter runs `ctaM3StmtAnchor(recordOnly = true)`:
the EXACT nested legacy arm surface (checkVarDeclAssignability + B127 inner
assignment — deliberately NOT registerConstLiteralUnionNarrowing /
walkFunctionBodiesInExpr, those are top-level-arm-only), under frame maps +
full anchor ambient, every diagnostic truncated. The frame sharing structure
(clause/Block frames share localTypes, copy varTypes) already models the
legacy leak; narrowing-DISCARD regions (the nested IfStatement arm's
copy-restore) are classified at the IfStatement's spine enter
(extractNullNarrowing under frame maps → `ctaM3DiscardThen` + depth
tracking) and skipped. TWO iteration lessons: (a) the discard rule's local
observability is genuinely poor (the then-recordings are block-scoped or
hoisted-but-unread shapes — the corpus narrowing pins are its guardian);
(b) the TS2563 trip machinery is STATEFUL across the emit-twice split — a
recordOnly walk that trips must NOT reportFlowControlError
(`ctaM3RecordOnlySuppress`): the truncation removes the TS2563 but a
persisted flowDisabledRanges registration makes the legacy walk bail
SILENTLY (CfaTooLargeBailTest caught it — the diagnostic would be lost and
TS2454s mis-filtered). With recordings reproduced, the barrel switch shape
became anchor-eligible and stayed green (BarrelCheckDefinedReturnTest + the
new single-file switch-recording pin). Gates: corpus 11,318/0; listAll ×8
error-line identical vs m3d. NEXT: the remaining stmt-kind arms at anchored
scopes (If/Switch/For/While/Try dispatch arms with their narrowing wrappers)
— or extend anchor eligibility to method/arrow/fn-expr bodies (needs
currentClassForThis + the accessor quirks reproduced).

**Round 570 (2026-07-17) — round 569's enabling fix LANDED: inference-aware
contextual param typing (skip un-inferred callee TPs).** The property-access
pass's contextual param registration (ArrowFunction + FunctionExpression
twins) skips a param whose contextual type carries an UN-INFERRED callee TP
(`typeContainsUnresolvedTypeParam`) — the bare-TP registration was the
round-568 drift mechanism's substrate: with the TP registered, the TS2339
verdict on its members flips on WHEN the TP's constraint materialized
(constraint-based FP vs uncertainty-bail). Un-registered, the param stays
`any` (suppression-only) and the verdict is order-FREE, per the B136
concreteness discipline + the round-431 inference-gap class. Pinned by
`UninferredTpCallbackParamTest` (3 tests: constrained + unconstrained
un-inferred TP callback params → no TS2339; negative control: a concrete
contextual param type still fires). Gates: corpus 11,310/0 (+3 local);
listAll ×8 vs HEAD error-line IDENTICAL (the fix only removes the
order-dependence — in legacy order the bare-TP verdicts were already
silent bails on all profiles).
**Round 570b — (cta-m3c) RE-LANDED: the fn-body sandwich is ALWAYS-ON.**
The round-568 revert is undone: `ctaFnBodyFrame`'s sandwich (shadowing
helpers + TP scope/constraint materialization + param typing) runs
unconditionally. The standing acceptance probe PASSED: harness listAll at
the 94-error no-FP floor, ZERO fourslashImpl TS2339 lines, all 8 profiles
error-line IDENTICAL vs the round-570 baseline; corpus 11,310/0. The cta
fn-body tier is UNBLOCKED — production fn frames carry real context
(fnTpScope/fnTpDecls + typed varTypes/localTypes), so the m3 statement
anchor can extend into function bodies. The +~4% frame-construction cost
stands; the lazy/copy-on-write follow-up stays queued (round 568c).
**Round 570c — (cta-m3d) LANDED: SIMPLE fn-body statement emissions join
the spine anchor.** Fn-body-DIRECT VariableStatement/ExpressionStatement/
ReturnStatement emissions of eligible FunctionDeclaration chains dispatch
from the anchor; the legacy marks extend via the SHARED predicate
`ctaM3FnBodyAnchorScope` (gate identity by construction). The corpus gate
caught THREE drifts on the first attempt, each a lesson: (1) the anchor's
VariableStatement arm threaded `emptySet()` typeParams (m3a artifact) —
the fn's own TPs read as FOREIGN and the round-431e gate bailed genuine
TS2322s (Inv5GenericGateTest); (2) the m3c sandwich ran with an EMPTY
inferenceNamespaceStack — shadowNestedFunctionNames' round-461 ns-exports
consult diverged the frame shadow state (m3c didn't notice because
nothing CONSUMED the frames); (3) the STRUCTURAL one: legacy nested-scope
dispatches (switch clauses/if branches/loop-try bodies) RECORD into the
shared currentLocalTypes (the load-bearing leak) and the spine frames
have NO reproduction — a later anchored statement reads an INCOMPLETE map
(BarrelCheckDefinedReturnTest: the switch-clause `importLiteral`
recording feeding `end = importLiteral.end`'s member reduction). Hence
the anchor-SIMPLE rule: every fn body on the chain restricted to
{Var/Expr/Return/FunctionDeclaration} statements. Lifting it = the next
tier's work item: reproduce the nested-dispatch localTypes recording
order spine-side (or migrate the nested dispatchers themselves). Pinned
by CtaFnBodyAnchorTest (exactly-once across anchored + legacy-owned
chains). Gates: corpus 11,316/0; listAll ×8 identical vs m3c. NEXT:
either the nested-scope recording reproduction (lifts anchor-SIMPLE) or
the remaining stmt kinds arm-by-arm at eligible scopes.

### QUEUE — work top-to-bottom; promote unblockers per protocol

(Restored 2026-07-12, round 481 — the queue/backlog/inventory sections had been
swept into PLAN-PHASE-5-HISTORY.md by an over-eager session-note trim; they are
LIVE structure, not history. v1's offline-verifiable legs LANDED at round 481, so
M5 is now the active arc per the owner directive; the Post-v1 backlog below is the
"any TypeScript project" horizon and stays parked until the owner re-scopes. The
M1–M3 campaign items still unchecked in the history file (M2.2/M2.3/M3.1–M3.4/M1.12)
hit their re-scoped v1 acceptance bar — "the shapes tsc's source uses" — when the
burn-down reached zero real FPs; reviving their full-completeness form is a
backlog-horizon decision, not queue debt.)

**EP — Emit parity (owner-authorized 2026-07-12: "output parity, including reported errors").**
The offline v1 DoD checked emit COMPLETENESS (all files emitted, exit 0) but not
emit-BYTE parity with tsc. The round-483 emit diff (`scripts/emit-diff-tsc.sh`, xtsc
vs npm `tsc@6.0.3` on the `compiler` profile) found 8/78 byte-identical, 70/78
differing — but **none are miscompiles**; xtsc's output is semantically correct and
runnable. Three systematic families explain nearly all changed lines (sequenced
cheap-first to shrink the diff before tackling the hard cross-file one):

- [x] **EP.3 Logical/nullish-assignment downleveling** (`||=`/`&&=`/`??=` below
  ES2021). DONE round 484 (2026-07-12): `Transformer.downlevelLogicalAssignment` —
  `a ||= b` → `a || (a = b)` etc., with side-effecting property/element receivers
  captured into temps (`(_a = obj())[_b = key()] || (_a[_b] = 6)`, tsc-faithful temp
  naming). ~284 sites in the compiler profile. Gated `effectiveTarget < ES2021`;
  corpus has ZERO files exercising these operators so it's pinned by
  `LogicalAssignmentDownlevelTest` only. KNOWN RESIDUAL: a `??=` target BELOW ES2020
  keeps a native `??` (not further downleveled — ES2020 is the tested/dashboard
  target); close when a sub-ES2020 `??=` case appears.
- [ ] **EP.2 Multi-line expression printer formatting.** Match tsc's operator/`:`
  placement (line-end vs line-start) and indentation when wrapping long
  `||`/`&&`/ternary chains. Mechanical Emitter work, no cross-file dependency, but
  HIGHER corpus-regression risk (touches the printer that the green corpus pins) —
  do it with the emit-diff gate in place and verify the full suite after each step.
- [ ] **EP.1 Cross-module const-enum inlining** (highest impact, ~93% of the changed
  lines in files like utilities.js). xtsc inlines SAME-FILE const enums but keeps
  `mod.Enum.Member` for const enums imported across modules; tsc inlines to
  `VALUE /* Enum.Member */` (numeric AND string-valued). Needs the checker to resolve
  imported const-enum values whole-program. Biggest/hardest (cross-file), collapses
  most of the diff. NOTE: xtsc's form still RUNS (preserveConstEnums keeps the enum
  objects) — this is byte-fidelity, not correctness.
- [ ] **EP.0 Wire the emit-diff gate into the dashboard.** `scripts/emit-diff-tsc.sh`
  exists (reports identical/differing + family signals). Ideal reference is a tsc
  BUILT AT THE PINNED COMMIT (npm tsc adds version noise to the small residual tail,
  esp. emitHelpers.js helper bodies); decide whether to build+cache the pinned tsc or
  accept the version-stable family signals. Re-run after EP.2/EP.1 to track the diff
  shrinking.

Session note (round 484) has the full family breakdown + methodology.

**INV — the M5 architecture-inversion arc (re-scoped 2026-07-13, owner; supersedes
M5.1–M5.7 — mapping and full design in `docs/ARCHITECTURE-RETHINK.md`, READ IT FIRST).**
Ground rules for every INV item: corpus suite green + 8-profile FP floors unchanged +
`--listAll` byte-diff empty for behavior-preserving steps + a bench TSV row per landed
item; decompose into the smallest standalone suite-gated commits; micro-opt rounds
against the flat profile are CLOSED (only an INV.0-evidenced ≥5% single lever may
interrupt the arc).

- [x] **(cta-m3e) Lift the anchor-SIMPLE restriction — reproduce the legacy
  nested-dispatch localTypes recordings spine-side (queued round 570c with the
  design from the BarrelCheckDefinedReturnTest root-cause).** The blocker: legacy
  nested-scope dispatches RECORD into the shared `currentLocalTypes` and the spine
  frames have no reproduction, so an anchored statement after a switch/if/loop
  reads an incomplete map. Design notes (verified in-code round 570): (a) the leak
  is PER-ARM — switch clauses LEAK (clause dispatch shares the map), a NARROWING-
  wrapped if-then (extractNullNarrowing non-null — a pure function of the
  condition, callable at spine time) DISCARDS its recordings on restore, a
  non-narrowed if-then Block LEAKS (the Block arm copies varTypes but NOT
  currentLocalTypes), loop/try bodies leak via the same Block arm; (b) the
  mechanism: a RECORDING-ONLY sandwich at nested VariableStatement enters within
  an active fn frame — install the frame maps, run the real
  checkVarDeclAssignability under a diagnostics mark, truncate ALL its
  diagnostics (nested statements stay legacy-owned for emission), keep the map
  writes; skip inside narrowing-discarded regions; (c) spine statement-position
  Block/clause frames already model the map SHARING — the narrowed-if discard
  needs a COPIED-map frame rule keyed on extractNullNarrowing; (d) gates: the
  barrel repro shape as a local pin (switch-clause recording feeding a later
  anchored statement's member reduction), corpus + listAll ×8. Alternative if the
  recording-only sandwich disturbs first-touch caches: migrate the nested
  dispatchers' arms themselves (bigger). DONE round 571 — the recording-only
  sandwich landed clean (one extra invariant found: TS2563 trip-state suppression
  during recordOnly, CfaTooLargeBailTest); see the session note.
- [x] **INV.0 Instrument the multiplier.** DONE round 491 (2026-07-13):
  `PassTiming.kt` + non-inline `pass(name) {}` around all 514 init dispatch calls +
  the three counters (`getTypeOfExpression` calls/distinct with per-pass attribution,
  `nodeTypes` cacheable/bypassed/hit, depth-0 flow walks at `flowWalkWithTripCheck`),
  behind the `--passTiming` CLI flag; off-mode byte-identical (listAll A/B + wall
  parity) + suite green (+7 local). The table (round-491 session note): checker-init
  = 83% of wall; top-3 passes 38.6% (property-access / assignability / call-types,
  458k of 595k getTypeOfExpression calls, 84k flow walks — 68% from
  checkPropertyAccess); 474 sub-100 ms passes sum 36.5% = the multiplication tail.
  That note's cost-ordered worklist IS the INV.4 migration order.
- [x] **INV.1 Concurrent front-end — the owner's Flow beachhead (owner-approved
  kotlinx-coroutines-core dependency, 2026-07-13).** Sub-steps: (a) DONE round 492 —
  the dep was already in commonMain; landed the `runCompilerPipeline` expect/actual
  seam (JVM `runBlocking`) + the import-graph crawl as a cold sequential Flow
  (`crawlImportGraph`, ProjectCompiler) with the load-bearing emission-order
  contract documented at the seam (suite +3, listAll A/B byte-identical); (b) DONE
  round 493 — read+decode on `Dispatchers.IO` (`pipelineIoDispatcher`
  expect/actual), extraction parse on `Dispatchers.Default`, bounded
  `flatMapMerge(16)` per frontier (`readAndScanBatch`); resolution + emission stay
  sequential per frontier so emission stays first-discovery order (the binder stays
  sequential; parser audited — no shared mutable state); (c) DONE round 493 —
  corpus green (+6 local) + 3× `--listAll` byte-identical vs the (a) binary; (d)
  DONE round 493 — interleaved A/B −0.8 s (~3%) on the compiler profile + bench
  TSV row.
- [x] **INV.1(e) Kill the double parse — reuse the crawl's parses in the core.**
  DONE round 494 (2026-07-13): `computeParserFlags` (the shared single source of
  truth for the option-derived `Parser` flags, used by the core's parse sites AND
  the crawl), `ParsedSource.preParsed` carrying `PreParsedFile(content, flags,
  sourceFile, diagnostics)`, and the core's multi-file site reusing an entry ONLY
  on an exact content+flags match (else re-parse — reuse is a pure optimization).
  Verified: suite +6 (Inv1PreParseReuseTest — sentinel-tree reuse proof + both
  mismatch gates + driver-path counters), `--listAll` byte-identical on compiler
  AND services, reuse fires 78/78 (`--passTiming` counters), interleaved wall A/B
  neutral within noise on both profiles (the parse leg is small next to the
  checker; the point is one canonical tree per file — the INV.2 enabler).
  CLAUDE.md gotcha: a new option-derived Parser argument must extend
  `ParserFlags`, never a parse site inline, or the match reuses a wrong tree.
- [x] **INV.2 Bind the world** — COMPLETE round 499 (all four sub-items landed;
  the tables' mass consumption is INV.4's migration). Decomposed round 494
  (facts verified in-code:
  `Node` is a sealed interface + ~138 data classes with single-interface supertypes
  `) : Expression/Node/TypeNode/Statement/Declaration/ClassElement`; there is NO
  generic child-walk anywhere; nodes have no parent/id fields; `Symbol.id` is a
  GLOBAL companion `nextId++` (Types.kt:116–127, the ~350-test reshuffle anchor);
  `nodeKey` is the cross-file-colliding `(pos<<32)|end`). Work the sub-items in
  order, one commit each:
  - [x] **INV.2(a) AST identity foundations.** DONE round 495 (2026-07-13):
    `NodeBase` (nodeId/parent, NOT implementing Node — preserves sealed-`when`
    exhaustiveness) + 138 supertype edits + `SourceFile.nodeCount`; canonical
    `forEachChild` (exhaustive sealed `when`) + iterative preorder
    `indexSourceFile` hooked into `Parser.parse()`. Pinned by the jvmTest
    reflection oracle (`ForEachChildOracleTest` — componentN diff over fixtures +
    all 78 real tsc sources) + `Inv2NodeIndexTest` (dense preorder / parent
    chains / copy-unindexed / 30k-chain-on-plain-thread). Suite +10 (10,228),
    `--listAll` byte-identical, wall neutral. Gotchas: NodeBase LUB trap +
    power-assert node-toString trap.
  - [x] **INV.2(b) Pilot consumer.** DONE round 496 (2026-07-13):
    `FlowGraph.flowAt` — nodeId arrays pre-computed from the finished map
    (preserves the nodeKey extent-ALIASING) + identity ownership check
    (synthesized/foreign nodes take the legacy path); 5 checker sites migrated;
    suite +3, listAll byte-identical, wall neutral. JFR verdict: getNode ≈6.7%
    of samples but nodeToFlow only ~4% of that slice (~0.3% wall) — mechanism
    validated; the mass-migration targets are the HOT maps (walk memos, INV.4
    per-node type cache), not more cold tables. `nodeTypes` rejected as pilot
    (structural cross-file keying — INV.5 territory).
  - [x] **INV.2(c) Full lexical binding, additive.** Scope symbols from a SEPARATE
    id space (never the global `nextId` sequence — the reshuffle hazard); existing
    `locals`/`globals` byte-unchanged; new tables unconsumed until INV.4.
    - (i) DONE round 497 (2026-07-13): function-like containers —
      `bindLexicalScopes` (Binder.kt) walks the whole tree iteratively after
      conventional binding, building per-nodeId `LexicalScope`s
      (`BinderResult.lexicalScopes`): SourceFile root aliases file locals,
      ModuleDeclaration aliases the merged exports (chained per dotted segment,
      the B512 rule), the 7 function-like kinds + static blocks get fresh tables
      (type params, params minus `this`, fn-expr self-name, body-top-level
      decls, `var`s hoisted from any block depth). `Symbol.scopeSymbol` mints
      ids ≤ −2; a delta-probe test pins zero global-id consumption. Suite +14
      (Inv2LexicalScopeTest), listAll byte-identical, interleaved wall
      position-balanced +0.8% (noise band).
    - (ii) DONE round 498 (2026-07-13, same session): block-scope containers —
      every Block that is not a function-like's immediate body, for/for-in/for-of
      headers, CatchClause (binds the catch variable, destructuring included),
      SwitchStatement standing in for tsc's CaseBlock (our AST has none — the
      switch EXPRESSION routes to the OUTER scope by hand) — plus class scopes
      (type params; named class-expression self-name; class decorators outer),
      interface/type-alias scopes (type params), and enum scopes (aliasing
      main-bound exports; nested enums bind scope-space members also published
      on the scope symbol's exports, gated `id ≤ −2` so main symbols stay
      untouched). Design dividend: the phase-(i) `isDirectBodyChild` gates for
      block-scoped declarations DISSOLVE into `scope.existing == null` (every
      fresh scope IS the correct nearest block-scope container); `var` gains the
      real `varHoistTarget` walk-up. Block-nested function declarations use
      strict/module semantics (bind to the block). Suite +6 (20 total in
      Inv2LexicalScopeTest — the phase-(i) negative controls flipped to
      positive location asserts), listAll byte-identical, interleaved wall ×6
      both orders neutral.
  - [x] **INV.2(d) B83.5 dissolution pilots.** DONE round 499 (2026-07-13): the
    canonical site — `checkPropertyAccessInStatement`'s ClassDeclaration branch —
    now resolves a block-scoped class via `lexicalScopeSymbol` (parent-chain walk
    over `currentLexicalScopes`, set per file in `checkPropertyAccess`; legacy
    transient synthesis kept as the unindexed-tree fallback). Fidelity proven:
    suite green, listAll byte-identical on compiler AND services; and the pilot
    FIXES a real FP — a block-level `interface B` + `class B` merge now
    contributes interface members to `this` (the transient class-only symbol
    could not see them; measured: the pre-pilot checker emitted a false TS2339).
    Candidate analysis: the other two `Symbol(SymbolFlags.Class, …)` syntheses
    are NOT B83.5 scope-binding shapes and stay — the B511 clodule recovery
    (the class symbol is main-bound then OVERWRITTEN by last-wins, so it is in
    neither table) and the classExpressionAssignment display synthesis (a
    ClassExpression is never a scope binding). Mass consumption of the tables
    (the ~59 synthesis sites, `buildNestedFunctionMap`, the per-pass scope
    machinery) is INV.4's migration proper.
- [ ] **INV.3 Per-file scoping** — decomposed round 500 (facts verified in-code:
  `perFileScope` EXISTS and is already consumed at 4 sites — the 17.32b–e flips
  (TS2663-vs-TS2301, TS2552 candidate pool, resolveExpressionToSymbol, file-root
  TS2304) — so the earlier "never consumed" note was stale; the remaining
  migration surface is ~400 keyed `globals` consults; import aliases free-ride on
  the conflation because the general `resolveAlias` cannot follow ESM-`.js`
  specifiers / `export *` barrels / NamespaceImports — the FLOW-ONLY resolvers
  can, and the general-fallback variant measured a TS2315×466 flood at round
  409). End state: module files resolve own-locals + imports + true globals;
  the `mergeSymbolTable` conflation is retired for module files; the conflation
  ecology is deleted. Also lays the cross-file value-resolution groundwork EP.1
  needs. Work the sub-items in order, one commit each:
  - [x] **INV.3(a) Instrument the conflation dependency.** DONE round 500
    (2026-07-13): `globals` constructed as `InstrumentedSymbolTable` under
    `--passTiming` (plain map otherwise — zero added code on the hottest map);
    every keyed lookup classified against the per-file visibility model
    (TRUE_GLOBAL / SHARED / OWN_LOCAL / CONFLATED / UNSCOPED — see
    `GlobalsLookupClass`) by a classifier installed after init step 1b, with
    per-name + per-pass conflated/unscoped tables in the dump. Measured
    (compiler / services profiles): 2.71M / 4.92M keyed lookups — 71% / 79%
    MISSES (globals probed as a maybe-fallback everywhere), ownLocal
    530k/703k (flips to per-file trivially), CONFLATED 157k/217k concentrated
    in 608/845 names (almost all `types.ts` type names reached through barrel
    imports; services adds the round-442 value-space leaks `parent`/`error`)
    and 14–15 passes with the top 3 = 95–96% of conflated traffic = INV.0's
    top-3 wall passes (checkPropertyAccess / checkCallExpressionTypes /
    checkTypeAssignability), SHARED only 2.9k/4.0k (the chimera ecology's
    cost is per-lookup bail checks, not hit volume), unscoped 71.8k/97.1k
    (checkUnresolvedNames + outside-dispatch). Worklist: (b)'s primitive must
    resolve barrel-imported TYPE names; (c) starts at the three hot passes.
    Suite +5 (Inv3GlobalsLookupTest), `--listAll` byte-identical (off-mode),
    bench row in band.
  - [x] **INV.3(b) Per-file resolution primitive.** COMPLETE round 502:
    - (i) DONE round 501 (2026-07-13): `lookupPerFile(fileName, name)`
      (internal, unconsumed by checker paths) — perFileScope lookup with an
      ImportSpecifier-alias local resolved onward through
      `resolveImportedSymbolGeneral` (the kind-AGNOSTIC generalization of the
      flow-only resolver skeleton: ESM-`.js` strip + `export *` barrels +
      renamed re-exports via the star walk's NamedExports arm + re-import
      hops; memoized `importedSymbolGeneralCache`; ADDITIVE — the three
      kind-specific legacy variants stay untouched, their per-decl
      kind-filter-then-continue semantics differ; never wired into
      `resolveAlias` per the round-409 flood gotcha). KEY TRAP hit and
      pinned: mergeSymbolTable FLAG pollution means an Alias flag cannot
      identify an import alias — a barrel-imported name's TARGET symbol
      acquires the Alias bit from the importing file's merge, so the hop
      test must be declaration-based (`isImportBindingDecl` — the
      isValueExport gotcha applied to alias hopping). Degradations
      documented in the KDoc: unresolvable import / default-import /
      `import * as ns` / `import =` aliases return the alias symbol itself
      (callers keep their existing handling — extend when a (c) flip needs
      them); null strictly means "no per-file meaning" (the conflation
      leak). Pinned by Inv3PerFileLookupTest (direct
      `Checker(options, binderResults)` construction — a first for local
      tests — asserting symbol IDENTITY with the declaring file's binder
      locals across direct-`.js`/barrel/renamed-re-export/own-local/
      script-global/lib shapes + the foreign-module-local null and
      alias-degradation negative controls).
    - (ii) DONE round 502 (2026-07-13): pilot consumer — the TS2315/TS2346
      heritage-base "not generic" gate (`checkTypeArgumentConstraints`, the
      smallest nonzero pass in the (a) conflated-by-pass table with DIRECT
      pass-local consults) resolves through the NEW
      `globalsForFile(fileName, name)`, THE (c) flip shape: return the
      merged-globals INSTANCE whenever the name has a per-file meaning (a
      non-module-only name, or a module-only name the file declares/imports
      — probed via `lookupPerFile`; substituting the primitive's return
      directly would change symbol identity for lib/script names), null
      exactly where the legacy consult leaked a foreign module file's local
      (suppression-only at this site: real tsc never emits TS2315 for an
      unresolvable base). Supporting infra always-on: init 1b2 became
      `computePerFileVisibility` — publishes `moduleOnlyGlobalNames`
      (module-file local names minus lib/script/augmentation-visible), the
      INV.3(a) classifier installs on top of the same sets. Both mirrored
      consult sites flipped together (kept-in-sync contract); the conflated
      branch never touches `globals`, so the `--passTiming` conflated
      tables keep measuring only UN-migrated traffic. MEASUREMENT LESSON
      for (c): the post-flip instrumented run shows the pass STILL at 11
      conflated with the total lookup count EXACTLY unchanged (2,711,601)
      — the pass's conflated traffic comes from DEEPER shared machinery
      (`checkConstraintsForTypeArgs` → `getTypeFromTypeNode`), not the
      direct pass-local consults, which measured ZERO conflated hits on
      the compiler profile. Per-PASS attribution ≠ per-SITE: a hot-pass
      (c) flip needs per-site reasoning about which consults inside the
      pass actually carry the conflated traffic. Suite +7
      (Inv3GlobalsForFileTest — both leak-kill tests FAIL on the pre-flip
      checker, verified via stash; five preservation controls pass on
      both); `--listAll` byte-identical on compiler AND services.
  - [x] **INV.3(c) Flip resolution families onto the primitive** — COMPLETE
    round 509 (all four sub-items landed; conflated 157k → 917, the residue
    being the INV.3(d)-scoped shadow ecology). Decomposed
    round 503 from a MEASURED per-site attribution (a temporary 1:200
    stack-sampling probe on the classifier's CONFLATED branch, ~790 samples,
    probe reverted — evidence in the round-503 session note). The guessed
    site list above was WRONG: `getTypeFromTypeReference`'s globals fallback
    measured ZERO conflated hits and `resolveTypeNameToSymbol`'s Identifier
    entry only ~1.2% — the actual distribution:
    **~82% is ONE family, the enum-discriminant/kind-domain narrowing
    machinery** (`kindDomainKeysFromTypeNode` → `enumSwitchKeysFromTypeNode` /
    `enumMemberKeysOfTypeNode` / `kindDomainTypeDeclSymbol` /
    `resolveEnumSymbolForDiscriminant`, reached from `narrowByCallPredicate`
    via `applyConditionNarrowing`, plus smaller entries from
    `filterUnionByEnumDiscriminant`/`resolveCallOverload`), which resolves
    type names read from FOREIGN AST nodes — types.ts's union-member `.kind`
    annotations — while `currentFileLocals` points at the CHECKING file
    (exactly the top conflated names: JSDocFunctionType / FunctionTypeNode /
    ConstructorTypeNode / MappedTypeNode / ConditionalTypeNode). The
    per-file-correct key there is the NODE'S OWNING FILE (tsc semantics: a
    types.ts annotation resolves in types.ts's scope), NOT
    `currentCheckFileName` — a naive `globalsForFile(currentCheckFileName,…)`
    flip would silently kill narrowing in files that don't import the name.
    The rest: `identifier.fallback` ~3.8k + `propAccess.objExpr` ~3k (tagged
    counts), `checkPrivateMemberAccess`, `getTypeOfIdentifier ←
    isCalleeResolvable`, `resolveFlowCalleeDecl ←
    flowCalleeMayHaveAssertEffects`, `computeRawTypeOfPropertyAccess ←
    getCalleeType`, `typeNodeDefinitelyNonNullish`, `pmrCheckAccess`,
    `mam.objectExpr`/`mam.recvSym` (~63 each). Sub-items, one commit each,
    every flip suite+listAll-gated on compiler AND services:
    - (i) DONE round 504 (2026-07-13): the node-keyed resolution primitive —
      `owningSourceFile(node)` (NodeWalk.kt: parent-chain walk to the
      SourceFile, null for unindexed `copy()`/synthesized/detached nodes,
      defensive hop bound) + `lookupPerFileForNode(node, name)` =
      `globalsForFile(owner.fileName, name)` with legacy-merged-consult
      degradation for ownerless nodes. Additive/unconsumed; pinned by
      Inv3NodeKeyedLookupTest (direct construction — a foreign-node
      annotation resolves under its OWNING file's visibility to the same
      merged instance; an owner without the name yields null (the leak);
      an importing owner keeps resolving; an unindexed copy degrades to
      legacy; lib names never nulled).
    - (ii) DONE round 505 (2026-07-13): the kind-domain/enum-discriminant
      family (~82% of conflated traffic) flipped onto the node-keyed
      primitive — `resolveEnumSymbolForDiscriminant`/`kindDomainTypeDeclSymbol`
      thread a `keyNode` (all 5 call sites), and the alias fallbacks in
      `enumSwitchKeysFromTypeNode`/`enumMemberKeysOfTypeNode` (incl. the
      round-477 import-alias fallback) consult `lookupPerFileForNode(node,
      name)`; `currentFileLocals` stays the first consult everywhere.
      Companion: `globalsForFile`'s proven-visible branch reads UNCLASSIFIED
      (`InstrumentedSymbolTable.getUnclassified`) under `--passTiming`, so a
      legitimate foreign-node hit — CONFLATED against the CHECKING file's
      locals — no longer pollutes the migration tables. Suite +5
      (Inv3KindDomainNodeKeyTest — leak-kill FAILS pre-flip via stash;
      4 preservation controls pass both sides); listAll byte-identical on
      compiler AND services.
    - (iii) **Flip the current-file-keyed value/callee sites** — these read
      names from the CURRENT file's own AST; node-keying by the name's
      IDENTIFIER node is the uniform shape (equals current-file keying for
      own nodes); suppression-only where the name classifies conflated.
      Phase 1 DONE round 506 (2026-07-13): the protected-member cluster
      (pw/pmr/pm, TS2445/TS2446 — `pmrCheckAccess`'s static consult, the
      ctor-init consult, and the `pwResolveClass`/`pmrResolveClass` funnels
      every heritage walker feeds) keys by the name Identifier via
      `lookupPerFileForNode` — the heritage walkers wrap a REAL indexed
      Identifier in a synthesized TypeReference, so keying by `typeName`
      (never the wrapper) needs zero signature changes; a fully-synthesized
      identifier (pmrLocalClass's from-text one) degrades to the legacy
      consult inside the primitive. Suite +5 (Inv3ProtectedNodeKeyTest —
      both leak-kill tests FAIL pre-flip via stash: the leaked resolution
      manufactured bogus TS2445 about a class the file never imports);
      listAll byte-identical on compiler AND services. Phase 2 DONE round
      507 (2026-07-13): the bare-Identifier VALUE/receiver/callee cluster —
      checkPrivateMemberAccess, getCalleeType's Identifier branch,
      resolveFlowCalleeDecl (+ the extracted currentFileNestedPredicateDecl
      preserving round-471 narrowing from the direct==null fallback too),
      resolveNamespaceMemberFnDecl, the three ns-fallback receiver
      resolvers (computeRawTypeOfPropertyAccess /
      resolvePropertyAccessToSymbol / propertyAccessChainIsNamespaceQualified),
      isCalleeResolvable, checkPropertyAccessAssignment's ns base, the two
      mam receiver consults, and the protected-ctor heritage walks
      (findEffectiveConstructorVisibility/classExtendsOrIs) — all keyed by
      the name's own Identifier node. Conflated 20,941 → 10,034 (−52%);
      suite +9 (Inv3ValueCalleeNodeKeyTest — 4 leak-kills FAIL pre-flip via
      stash); listAll byte-identical on compiler AND services; bench in
      band. Phase 3 DONE round 507b (2026-07-13) — (iii) COMPLETE:
      `getTypeOfIdentifier`'s globals fallback node-keyed (the round-442
      by-NAME dead-end does NOT reproduce per-FILE — imports resolve
      through the visibility probe to the same merged instance; pinned by
      Inv3IdentifierTypingNodeKeyTest incl. the import-driven
      initializer-inference control from the round-442 regression family),
      plus a fast path in `lookupPerFileForNode` (non-module-only names
      skip the parent walk — the fallback is ~2M calls/compile). Conflated
      10,034 → 6,165 (cumulative 20,941 → 6,165, −71%); `factory` gone;
      checkImplicitAnyParameters 2,608 → 171, checkUncalledFunctions 968 →
      189. Suite green 10,298 → 10,302 (+4); listAll byte-identical on
      compiler AND services; bench +4.0% single-run = the documented
      box-drift band (~126k parent walks ≈ negligible by construction).
      Residue ~6.2k = the (iv) type-position tail (types.ts type names
      reached via typeNodeDefinitelyNonNullish / resolveTypeNameToSymbol /
      getTypeFromBaseTypeExpression) + ~500 value-name lookups in the
      shadow-detection ecology (registerNestedGlobalShadow*/
      applyBodyLocalShadowing/shadowNestedFunctionNames ask "does a merged
      global collide" — they die with INV.3(d), do not flip them) + tiny
      tail sites (emitTs2345ForBareTpArgToConstrainedTpParam,
      getOverloadImplementationRelated, calleeReturnAnnotationForImplicitAny
      — fold into (iv)'s re-measure).
    - (iv) **Flip the type-position tail**. Leg 1 DONE round 508 (2026-07-13):
      `resolveTypeNameToSymbol`'s Identifier branch + `typeNodeDefinitelyNonNullish`'s
      two fallbacks flipped JOINTLY per the round-507c order constraint, with
      the two call-site trailing `?: globals[name]` fallbacks
      (`getTypeFromTypeReference`, `checkConstraintsInTypeNode`'s TS2315
      emitter) gated to QualifiedName — for Identifier names they were
      byte-redundant pre-flip and would silently RE-LEAK the node-keyed null
      post-flip (the trap now in the CLAUDE.md INV.3(c) entry). The full
      suite caught a REAL visibility gap the flip exposed:
      `lookupPerFileForNode` now grants a node inside a `declare module
      "<relative-spec>"` AUGMENTATION block the augmented module's direct
      named exports (the round-443 rule; the innermost string-named
      ModuleDeclaration is captured during the parent walk, unclassified
      under --passTiming) — without it the flip nulled `UnionType` inside
      services-style `declare module "./types.js"` blocks and this-predicate
      narrowing died (ThisPredicateNarrowingTest's augmentation pin).
      Test-design lesson: the ADDITIVE leak-kill direction is SHADOWED by
      any-degradation (an unresolvable callee annotation degrades the
      assigned reference to `any` — proven with a never-declared `Zorp`
      control — masking the TS18048/TS2322 consumers), so the flow
      observable uses the SUPPRESSION direction: a foreign UNIMPORTED
      NULLABLE alias return-annotation pre-flip types the reference as the
      leaked union and manufactures TS18048 on a closure-captured read;
      post-flip it degrades to any and the leaked TS18048 dies (tsc-faithful).
      Suite +9 (Inv3TypePositionNodeKeyTest — 3 leak-kills FAIL pre-flip via
      stash: the flow TS18048, annotation-position TS2322, TS2315; 6
      preservation controls pass both sides); `--listAll` byte-identical on
      compiler AND services. Leg 2 DONE round 509 (2026-07-13) — **(iv) and
      the whole (c) migration COMPLETE**: getTypeFromBaseTypeExpression's
      Identifier fallback (PropertyAccess last-segment fallback kept legacy —
      the QualifiedName convention), emitTs2345ForBareTpArgToConstrainedTpParam,
      getOverloadImplementationRelated (keyed by the overload DECL's own name
      node — a nested/foreign collision no longer hands TS2793 a wrong-file
      impl pointer), calleeReturnAnnotationForImplicitAny (the
      uniqueFunctionDeclByName fallback still covers program-wide-unique
      names). Suite +5 (Inv3TypePositionLeg2NodeKeyTest — 2 leak-kills FAIL
      pre-flip via stash: a leaked foreign heritage base grafting members
      manufactured TS2741 on `const d: D = {}`, a leaked foreign
      constrained-TP callee manufactured TS2345; 3 preservation controls);
      listAll byte-identical on compiler AND services. RE-MEASURE (compiler
      profile): CONFLATED 6,165 → **917** (−85%; from the pre-migration 157k
      → −99.4%), 97 names / 9 passes, top 318/284/273 — the residue is the
      deliberately-legacy shadow-detection ecology (`diag`/`clone`/`map`/
      `factory` collision questions) + tiny tails, i.e. INV.3(d)'s scope.
      INV.3(d) is UNLOCKED.
  - [ ] **INV.3(d) Retire the merge + delete the ecology.** Stop merging
    module-file locals into `globals`; delete `moduleFileLocalVarNames`,
    `conflatedTypeAliasFiles`, `conflatedInterfaceFiles`,
    `conflatedEnumFileSubsets`, the per-file interface views, and the chimera
    bails — walker-by-walker, each deletion suite- and listAll-gated (each
    removes hot-path work from `checkMemberAccessMissing`).
    **THE RETIRE IS MERGED TO MAIN (round 512): sub-items (i)–(iv) all DONE —
    suite fully green (10,346/0/3) and ALL 8 profiles byte-identical to the
    pre-retire baselines. Remaining: (v) the ecology deletions (the round-473
    Identifier dispatch is already deleted as the (iv) residual fix — its
    removal is what restored the server/harness baselines).** What the branch
    proved (measured round 510): the retire
    must be STAGED BY NAME CLASS — retire only MODULE-ONLY names; SHARED names
    (module local colliding with a lib/script global: `Symbol`/`Node`/
    `Performance` riding the lib names) must KEEP merging until every lib-name
    consumer resolves per-file (the naive full retire measured 861 compiler
    FPs, the module-only cut 34, each traced to an unflipped consult by the
    classifier-MISS stack-probe technique). Sub-items to finish it, in order:
    - (i) DONE round 511 (2026-07-14): the ambiguous-constrained→foreign leg
      REVERTED (declaration-IDENTITY leg kept) — flipped the whole TP family
      (17 tests: the 8 corpus TP pins + 3 local negative controls +
      tsxTypeArgumentPartialDefinitionStillErrors ×2 + WhileTrueDefiniteAssignTest
      ×4, the last two collateral of the over-aggressive classification);
      checker.ts:7358 re-solved at the INFERENCE side —
      `tryInferSingleTypeParamFromArgs` soft-skips a CallExpression arg whose
      type still carries a TypeParam at forReturnType sites (tpSawAnyArg →
      anyType, the pre-retire any-degradation behavior; round-468
      CallExpression gate keeps own-TP identifier args anchoring). Pinned by
      ForeignTpInferenceSoftSkipTest (6); compiler+services listAll
      byte-identical.
    - (ii) DONE round 512 — all 14 corpus multi-file failures fixed (the last 6:
      union-discriminant objlit drill node-keyed; ns-import static TS2339 +
      the dir-relative resolveAlias legs; TS2749 file-keyed with the
      typeSideImportFallback gate; the B585 contextual-display hops; the JSDoc
      ImportType own-specifier resolution; the TS2415 imported-base flip).
      Round-511 record follows:
      heritage/implements walkers node-keyed (interfaceDeclaration3,
      interfaceImplementation6 — incl. the B563 ownership-gate mirror that
      killed the double TS2420), checkConstraintsForTypeArgs keyNode +
      ImportType presetSymbol (divergentAccessorsTypes6,
      unmetTypeConstraintInImportCall), checkTypeNameResolved's leftSym →
      globalsForFile (augmentExportEquals1/2 + decoratorMetadataWithImport…7),
      the mam type-only-winner + namespace-import value-side bail
      (noCrashOnImportShadowing), **and the session's critical find: the
      import hop (`resolveImportedSymbolGeneral`) lacked the DIR-RELATIVE
      resolver leg, so path-shaped extensionless imports (`/proj/src/f1.ts` →
      `./lib`) never hopped and EVERY import-mediated type died on real
      on-disk projects — masked pre-retire by the merge, invisible to the
      `.js`-specifier tsc profiles; found via the EnclosingImportIndexTest
      pins + a MainKt scratch-repro matrix.** REMAINING 6 (per-test roots,
      each needs a probe dig): exportStarFromEmptyModule (X.A.r static
      TS2339 through a local-shadowed star chain),
      allowImportClausesToMergeWithTypes (TS2749 default-import-of-value used
      as type), allowJscheckJsTypeParameterNoCrash (display regression:
      `WatchHandler<any>` unfolds to the fn-type — alias display lost),
      checkJsdocTypeTagOnExportAssignment2 (JS `@type import("./a").Foo`
      excess-prop TS2353 — the JSDoc path's cross-file resolution),
      declarationEmitPrivateSymbolCausesVarDeclarationEmit2 (TS2415 with
      cross-file computed `[x]` private members),
      indirectDiscriminantAndExcessProperty (single-file module: TS2322
      member-vs-discriminant `"foo" | "bar"` — the objlit-member drill's
      resolution; NOT tryEmitObjectVsNamedUnionArg, whose anonymous
      constituents defer to the discriminant walker).
    - (iii) DONE round 512 — the last 4 were 2 real resolver gaps (the
      `export * as` arm in namespaceAliasMemberSymbol; the ns-member objlit ctx
      flips) + 2 pre-retire ACCIDENTAL PASSES fixed tsc-faithfully (all-missing
      all-anonymous union TS2339; primitive-vs-plain-object-bag TS2345).
      Round-511 record follows:
      (Inv3NodeKeyedLookupTest's unindexed-copy degradation → null for
      module-only names; Inv3GlobalsLookupTest's leak assertions inverted to
      the emptied-worklist victory condition); 3 more of the original 9
      flipped as REAL code fixes (EnclosingImportIndexTest ×2 +
      Inv3NodeKeyedLookupTest imports-keep-resolving via the dir-relative hop
      leg; ExtendsImplementsSameClassTest + NamespaceImportQualifiedTypeTest
      via the (ii) walker flips). REMAINING 4, all look like REAL
      suppressions to dig (scratch repros r7/r8 reproduce two):
      ConflatedTypeAliasLeakTest ×2 (own-file `type X` union TS2339 /
      own-file TS2345 both silent — receiver/param resolution in the alias's
      own file returns something unexpected post-retire),
      NamespaceQualifiedBaseInheritanceTest (export-star-as barrel base →
      TS2339 FP returned), BuilderChainAndNsMemberCtxTest (ns-member objlit
      contextual params → TS7006 FP returned).
    - (iv) DONE round 512 — all three residual families closed: deprecate.ts
      `compareTo` (an anyType shadow now BAILS mam instead of falling through
      to the outer import); session.ts protocol.Diagnostic (the round-473
      Identifier DISPATCH into conflatedPerFileInterfaceType REMOVED — the
      first (v) deletion, see the session note); fourslashImpl `'array'`
      (namedUnionMemberCouldAcceptArray hops import aliases). **Full 8-profile
      listAll A/B vs pre-retire main: ALL BYTE-IDENTICAL**; suite fully green;
      branch merged to main.
    - (v) DONE round 513 — ALL FOUR deletion groups landed (each suite- and
      8-profile-listAll-gated byte-identical): `moduleFileLocalVarNames` (+2
      masked narrowing gaps fixed), `conflatedTypeAliasFiles` (2 helpers
      re-keyed onto non-conflation conditions), `conflatedInterfaceFiles`
      objlit/relation chimera bails + TS2430/heritage view arms, and the
      per-file-view core (`conflatedPerFileInterfaceType`/`perFileInterfaceType`/
      owner-context threading) + `conflatedEnumFileSubsets`. SURVIVORS
      (deliberate): `moduleInterfaceNames`+`isLibPhantomMemberOfModuleInterface`
      (lib+module SHARED merges persist), `interfaceDeclsForCurrentFileView`
      discriminant reading, the re-keyed augmentation/alias-union bridges, the
      `A && objlit` falsy-remainder emitter, and the `nodeTypes` bypass re-keyed
      as `isPerFileDependentRefNode` on `multiFileModuleTypeNames` (the
      structural cache's cross-file position collisions are NOT
      conflation-specific — see the session note). **INV.3(d) is COMPLETE; the
      INV.3 arc is COMPLETE. NEXT: INV.4.**
- [ ] **INV.4 Single-pass check spine.** `checkSourceFileOnce` per-node dispatch;
  migrate walker families in INV.0's cost order — every migration deletes a full-tree
  pass and its private scope machinery. Once ONE authoritative walk state exists, land
  the two things that are unsound today: a per-node expression-type cache, and flow
  narrowing folded into reference typing once (collapsing the rounds-408–479
  per-consumer wiring). Decomposed round 514. Cross-cutting rules for every
  sub-item: (1) the spine is dispatched as ONE `pass("checkSpine")` at a FIXED
  init position (the earliest migrated pass's slot); passes migrating in from
  LATER positions move their emissions earlier in insertion order — the stable
  diagnostic sort (start→length→code→message) hides all but exact 4-tuple ties,
  and the per-migration corpus + listAll gates decide each case. (2) A spine
  handler sees ALL nodes: a hand-walk's accidental under-visits (arrow bodies,
  class/function expressions, initializers) become visits — per migrated pass,
  decide widen-vs-gate by the CLAUDE.md emission-direction rule (a
  position-independent tsc grammar rule widens faithfully; an FP-firewalled
  heuristic walker must reproduce its descent gates via parent-chain checks).
  (3) Every migrated pass with no local pins gets them BEFORE migration (the
  corpus pins emit bytes, not checker diagnostics — `.errors.txt` is disabled,
  so local tests are the primary under-emission gate). (4) Suite green +
  8-profile listAll + bench row per landed commit.
  - [x] **INV.4(a) Spine skeleton + pilot migration.** DONE round 514
    (2026-07-14): `checkSpine()` at the old checkAccessorModifierTarget slot —
    iterative enter/leave preorder walk per file (explicit parallel stacks;
    10k-chain pinned), per-file spine context fields declared BEFORE `init`,
    per-node `when` dispatch in `spineEnterNode`/`spineLeaveNode` (tsc
    checkSourceElement-style; plain private handler funs), active-handler
    gate skips the walk when every migrated handler is off (the profiles
    target ES2020 → pilot handler off → bench-neutral by construction).
    Pilot: TS18045 migrated — threaded `inAmbient` became an INV.2
    parent-chain ancestry check ([spineInAmbientContext]); the 78-line
    private walk deleted; coverage widened faithfully to class expressions /
    arrow bodies (position-independent grammar rule; both directions pinned).
    Suite +9 (Inv4SpineAccessorModifierTest), listAll byte-identical on
    compiler AND services (46/46; header-only argv difference), bench row in
    band. The leave hook is the scope-pop extension point — its pairing gets
    its first real pin when the first stateful migration lands.
  - [x] **INV.4(b) Tail-pass batches.** Migrate the 474-pass sub-100 ms tail
    (7.3 s = 36.5% of checker-init, round-491 table) in batches of ~5–15 per
    commit, most-mechanical first (zero-typing grammar/AST-shape walkers with
    per-file prepasses moving to a file-enter hook); each batch deletes its
    walks. Re-measure `--passTiming` every few batches; stop batching a shape
    that resists (stateful scope machinery) and queue it for (c)/(d) instead.
    Batch 1 DONE round 514 (2026-07-14): checkInvalidGlobalAugmentations
    (TS2669/TS2670) + checkReservedWordInterfaceParams (TS7051/TS7006) —
    both old walks descended ONLY through module bodies, so reachability is
    reproduced as a module-chain parent-walk gate (the template for
    module-scope-only walkers); the reserved-params handler deliberately does
    NOT widen to function/class-nested interfaces (a behavior change to make
    on a signal, not as a migration side effect); currentFileLocals is now
    set per file in checkSpine's loop (isTypeLikeParamName consults it); the
    spine walk is ALWAYS-ON from this batch (the TS2669 handler is
    unconditional and covers .d.ts — the .d.ts fast-skip lifted into
    per-handler gates). Suite +10 (Inv4SpineBatch1Test), listAll
    byte-identical on compiler AND services. WALK-COST measurement
    (interleaved 3-pair A/B vs the pre-batch binary — the round-493 rule): the
    first-cut enter/leave walk cost a REAL +1.0 s median on the compiler
    profile (boxing ArrayList<Boolean> phase stack + a leave frame per LEAF);
    fixed same commit — primitive BooleanArray phase stack + leaf shortcut
    (leave fires inline for childless nodes, no re-push) → re-interleaved
    NEUTRAL within noise (pair deltas +861/−1063/+574 ms, mean +124 ms).
    Per-frame costs are the whole game in a walk that visits every node —
    the walk KDoc carries the warning. Batch 2 DONE round 515 (2026-07-14):
    checkNonArrayRestParameters (TS2370 — the two differently-shaped walks
    became ONE Parameter-enter handler dispatching on the parameter's PARENT
    kind: value-position parents get the keyword rule, type-position parents
    the optional-rest rule; both widened faithfully — position-independent
    per-signature grammar) + checkIteratorMethodExtraParameters
    (TS2488/TS2504) + checkAsyncYieldStarThenable (TS1320) — the prepass
    pair became spine COLLECTION (VariableDeclaration enter, VariableStatement
    parent gate) plus BUFFERED iteration positions/yield* candidates resolved
    at file END (spineResolveDeferredIterationChecks — preserves the old
    prepasses' use-before-decl semantics with NO extra walk; the template for
    collect-then-scan walkers). TS1320's statement-level-only reachability
    widened to a nearest-function-ancestor async-generator gate. 16 walker
    funs deleted (~460 lines), 3 init slots removed. Suite +21
    (Inv4SpineBatch2Test), listAll error lines identical on ALL 8 profiles,
    wall in band. Batch 3 DONE same round: checkForOfNonIterable (TS2495 —
    the per-run lib-exclusion gate became spineForOfNonIterableActive; the
    verdict helper checkForOfExprNonIterable retained unchanged) +
    checkAbstractAccessorReturnTypes (TS7033 — GetAccessor-enter handler;
    the ClassDeclaration-parent gate keeps class-EXPRESSION members
    unchecked; the `.js`/`.jsx` skip is deliberately NOT spineIsJsLike —
    the old pass ran on .mjs/.cjs); 6 more walker funs + the round-514
    orphaned TS18045 KDoc deleted. Suite +9 (Inv4SpineBatch3Test), listAll
    identical on ALL 8 profiles. Batch 4 DONE round 516 (2026-07-14):
    checkSetterParameterCount (TS1054/TS1049/TS1095 as Get/SetAccessor-enter
    handlers — TS1054/TS1049 widened faithfully to class expressions +

    checkUnresolvedNames (846 ms) +

    spine-maintained authoritative lexical state backed by the INV.2(c)
    `lexicalScopes` tables (their planned mass consumption). Decomposed round
    522 (facts verified in-code: the checkUnresolvedNames family is ~3,000
    lines — statement/class-element/expression/type/JSX walkers threading a

    checkTypeUsedAsValue is ~700 lines threading THREE ScopeNameSet chains
    (typeOnly/value/namespaceOnly) built from AST surveys — NOT symbol-shaped,

    loop/switch/try descent)). Sub-items, one commit each, every step suite-
    and 8-profile-listAll-gated:
    - [x] **(c)(i) Spine-maintained lexical scope state (infrastructure,
      always-on).** DONE round 522 (2026-07-15 — the checkbox was missed in
      that round's commit; see the round-522 session note for the full
      landing record). The walk maintains `spineCurrentScope` — push at a scope
      owner's enter (BEFORE its own handlers dispatch), pop after its leave —
      via a per-file nodeId→LexicalScope ARRAY built from
      `result.lexicalScopes` (the INV.2(b) boxing-avoidance trick; cleared by
      re-nulling only written ids); a SwitchStatement's scope is re-keyed
      onto its CLAUSE nodeIds at fill so the switch EXPRESSION stays in the
      outer scope (the binder's routing); function-body Blocks share the fn
      scope automatically (no map entry); decorator outer-scope routing is a
      documented deferred divergence (both the walk and the binder tables
      currently agree). `spineScopeLookup(name)` resolves symbols → existing
      → parent. Pinned by a test-only AUDIT mode (companion statics — tests
      cannot reach the Checker instance): every spine enter verifies the
      incremental scope against a parent-chain derivation, and identifier
      enters record `spineScopeLookup` resolutions into a trace the tests
      assert on (shadowing id splits, scope-space ids ≤ −2, switch-expression
      isolation, catch/enum/self-name/var-hoist shapes). Bench row (the walk
      gains one array probe per enter+leave).
    - [x] **(c)(ii) checkUnresolvedNames STATE swap.** DONE round 523
      (2026-07-15): the NameScope content queries (`has` / `isTypeParam` /
      `hasType` / `typeParamConstraintOf` / `hasLocalShadow` / the TS2552
      candidate pool) are hybrid — each NameScope carries `lex` (the binder
      [LexicalScope] a TRUSTED scope-owner site links; population SKIPPED
      when linked) and queries interleave the threaded sets with the lex
      levels each NameScope level introduced (`lex` down to `parent.lex`,
      preserving shadowing order). Trusted links: statement lists via a new
      `checkUnresolvedInStatements(owner)` param (Block / SourceFile / the
      FUNCTION node for fn bodies — body Blocks have no binder entry),
      for/for-in/for-of headers, catch, switch (binder keys the case scope
      by the switch nodeId — the expression is checked before linking, so
      no re-keying needed), class/class-expr/interface/type-alias TP scopes.
      Function SIGNATURE positions stay threaded (params/TPs) — the binder's
      flat fn table would leak body decls into param defaults (sub-ES2015
      pre-collect is the only path that may see them; pinned both ways).
      Untrusted levels skipped in queries: ModuleDeclaration (the walk's
      buildNamespaceScope is EXPORT-filtered; binder aliases ALL merged
      members), EnumDeclaration (EnumMember-filtered), SourceFile existing
      filtered by a per-file exclusion set (ambient external module names +
      the declare-global quirk); type-level scopes (mapped TP / infer /
      fn-TYPE params) stay threaded. Unindexed trees: every probe misses →
      legacy behavior by construction. Equivalence-gated: corpus green +
      8-profile listAll error-line-identical; walk-threaded flags stay
      threaded until (c)(iii).
    - [x] **(c)(iii) checkUnresolvedNames WALK swap.** Move the emission
      positions onto the spine (delete the ~15 recursive walkers); reach
      reproduced per the emission-direction rule (this family is (b)-class —
      direct emitters — so under-visits are reproduced via parent-chain
      gates, widenings only on a signal). Batch 1 DONE round 524 (2026-07-15):
      the spine maintains the family's NameScope chain (`spineUResStack` —
      lazy signature population / deferred-activation regions / decorator
      pre-population views reproduce the legacy walk's sequential-mutation
      order on the spine's fixed preorder; per-file ROOT shared via
      `unresolvedFileRootFor`, enabled by the `computeTypeLibResolution`
      split), audited per-Identifier against the legacy walk's scope
      fingerprints (Inv4UnresolvedSpineScopeTest, 2 deliberate-breakage
      sharpness probes). classContext / inFunction / hasArguments ride the
      maintained NameScope levels (no parent-chain re-derivation needed).
      Batch 2 DONE round 525 (2026-07-15): the STATEMENT-LEVEL walk swap —

      dispatch in spineUResDispatch against the maintained levels;
      FunctionDeclaration signature positions at child enters
      (lazy-population staging); the with-body / skipped-return /
      declare-fn+class under-visits as suppressed-region levels and the
      declare-module post-filter as the filter2304 level flag, both enforced
      by the spineUResEmit wrapper (which also nulls currentFileLocals — the
      legacy pass ran unscoped); the 10 statement descents in the
      expr/class-element walkers cut; checkUnresolvedNames retained only as
      the declarationOnly minimal driver (spineUResOnly). listAll gate:
      error-line SETS identical on all 8 profiles; within-file PRINT order
      shifts (emission order — the corpus suite gates the sorted output
      byte-identical). Batch 3 DONE round 526 (2026-07-15):
      checkUnresolvedInClassElement DELETED — class-member decorators/
      computed-names at member enter (the pre-population moment = the legacy
      B98.r111 view), TP/param/return positions via the shared
      spineUResFnSigDispatch with per-member-kind coverage flags, index
      signatures in the class scope; gated to class decl/expr parents
      (interface members stay with the batch-2 handler). Batch 4 DONE round
      527 (2026-07-16): the EXPRESSION walk swap — expression positions
      self-emit at their own enters, gated by `spineUResExprChecked` (a
      per-file nodeId-memoized ancestor walk over `spineUResExprEdge`
      ROOT/DESCEND/NONE verdicts reproducing the recursive walker's exact
      reach); NaN/shorthand/embedded-type/class-expr-heritage/JSX handlers
      dispatch per node kind; spineUResFnSigDispatch reduced to TYPE
      positions (checkTps flag = the legacy fn-expr/objlit-method
      no-constraint-check asymmetry); the TS2422 skip became the
      spineUResHeritageSkip nodeId set; arrow/fn-expr/objlit-method levels
      carry exprOwned so recursion-owned regions keep the retained walker.
      checkUnresolvedInExpr(Core) retained SOLELY for the type walker's

      checkUnresolvedInExpr(Core), the JSX attribute/child helpers — ~660
      lines): type positions self-emit at their own enters. Unlike batch 4's
      static classifier, the type ROOTs are MARKED — every dispatch site that
      called the walker now calls `spineUResMarkTypeRoot` (strictly before
      the marked subtree walks; the sites stay the single source of truth),
      and `spineUResTypeChecked` (per-file nodeId memo) walks ancestors over
      `spineUResTypeDescends` edges = the deleted walker's recursion arms

      `spineUResTypeChecked(typeLiteral)`, flipping `exprOwned` true there so
      the fn-sig dispatch covers what the retained walker's arms did.
      Verified: suite 10,804 → 10,832 (+28 Inv4SpineBatch19Test, ALL

      corpus-tuned NON-descent into for/while/do/switch/try bodies, class
      accessors/EXPRESSIONS, shorthand properties, and objlit-method param
      defaults; the plain-`=`-LHS TS2708 suppression is the REACHED_NONS
      status minted on the Equals-left edge — checkConstAssignment owns the
      assignment-target TS2708). The set chains stayed set-based as planned
      but became PULL-BASED memoized levels (`tavLevelAt`/`tavLevelFor` —
      the family's surveys are position-independent, so no batch-1-style
      lazy staging; the one order-sensitive spot, an objlit method's
      computed NAME seeing the OUTER scope, is a came-from-child owner
      skip). The file survey (TS18042 emission + currentForwardLibTypeNames
      included, verbatim) builds eagerly per file in checkSpine's loop
      (`tavBuildFileRoot`); TS2689 classifies at the CLASS enter and marks
      `spineTavHeritageSkip` before the heritage subtree walks (the deleted
      either/or: TS2689 OR the generic walk, never both). Suite
      10,832 → 10,872 (+40 Inv4SpineBatch20Test, ALL verified against the

      recursion's five explicit context parameters (contextuallyTyped /
      contextualType / viaUnionWithPrimitive / ctxAnnotation / ctxViaAssignment)
      become ONE push-maintained SpineIanyCtx value with frames defined at
      EXACTLY the edges the legacy recursion passed arguments over (a missed
      edge silently LEAKS the parent context — every reached expression-position
      edge must define, even to null); the binary left-spine loop dissolves into
      per-edge rules (right operand by operator; left inherits for `||`/`??`
      only); returnCtxAnnotation + inAmbientContext pull-derive from parent

      that leak across blocks → PUSH-maintained frames on the spine, not the
      pull-based rebuild) and the first pass from AFTER the three giants
      (slot-move pre-gate found the currentParamBindingNames leak as the ONLY

      LEAVE emission; ambient install per emission/recording. The CORPUS caught
      a second, subtler coupling the profiles could not: the pass CONSUMED the

      TS2540 readonly writes + TS2357 inc/dec targets + scanRegExpFull's
      TS1538/regex-grammar family riding the same walker). SCOUTED
      (2026-07-17, in-code): the most stateful (d) walker yet — a w2+w5
      hybrid. (1) constNames is a statement-ordered LIVE MutableMap per
      activated list (collect const/class/enum/fn/ns THEN check, let/var
      REMOVES an inherited name) → DA-style core frames with per-statement
      collect steps at direct-child enters; spawn rules are ASYMMETRIC:
      Block/switch-clause/try-blocks/ModuleBlock/class-member bodies COPY
      the top frame's live map, FunctionDeclaration/fn-expr/arrow-Block/
      IIFE-arrow-Block bodies get a FRESH EMPTY map (an outer const is NOT
      flagged inside a fn body — bug-compat), SourceFile seeds from the
      program-wide sharedConsts overlay (script files only; module files
      empty). (2) The For header is an EDGE overlay: condition/incrementor/
      body see outer+header consts, the INIT EXPRESSION sees outer only.
      (3) currentClassForThis/currentThisMemberIsCtorDirect pull-derive from
      the ancestor chain: per-member staticness, Constructor→ctorDirect,
      property-initializer→ctorDirect=false, fn-expr NULLS the class, arrow
      keeps it with ctorDirect=false, and an IIFE-ARROW is TRANSPARENT to
      ctorDirect (the CallExpression arm's immediatelyInvokedArrowCallee).
      (4) FunctionDeclaration bodies install currentLocalTypes/
      currentParamBindingNames copies + populateParameterLocalTypes (B116 —
      fn DECLS only, not methods/fn-exprs/arrows) — cumulative through
      nested fn decls; per-anchor pull-rebuild with per-owner memo (w1
      template). (5) This is a TYPING pass (checkReadonlyAssignmentTarget
      resolves receiver types) — slot-move pre-gate with the CORPUS
      mandatory; check for diagnostics-list probes before choosing
      enter-vs-leave dispatch (the round-537 lesson). Anchors: assignment-op
      BinaryExpressions (left-spine loop — emissions are per-spine-node, at
      each binary's own reach), ++/-- Prefix/Postfix, RegularExpressionLiteralNode.
      LANDED as scouted (enter-dispatch — no diagnostics probes); 19 pins
      (Inv4SpineBatch29Test) pre-verified on the OLD walker; suite 11,189 →

      SLOT-MOVE PRE-GATE LANDED AND VERIFIED (intact pass at the spine slot;
      corpus 11,170/0 + listAll ×8 error-line identical) — the ambient
      residue at the spine slot is proven equivalent, and the pass stays
      BEFORE checkTypeAssignability, whose end-of-pass filter suppresses
      TS7030 at its own TS2322 positions (it EXPECTS this pass's TS7030s to
      exist — do not move it past the giants). SCOUTED migration design
      (w1-template): 4-state reach classifier (STMT/EXPR/MEMBER/NONE) over
      walkStmtForImplicitReturns/walkExprForImplicitReturns arms; anchors at
      FunctionDeclaration/MethodDeclaration/GetAccessor/FunctionExpression/
      ArrowFunction enters (the retained check*ForImplicitReturn bodies
      minus their trailing walkForImplicitReturns recursion); per-dispatch
      ambient install of implicitReturnFlowGraph + currentCheckFileName +
      the PRE-SPINE resting currentFileLocals/currentFunctionParams
      (checkGetAccessorForImplicitReturn reads currentFunctionParams'
      RESTING value — it never sets it; capture both at checkSpine entry
      like spineArithBase). Per-file gate: !isDts && (checkJs || !(.js|.jsx))
      — NOTE .mjs/.cjs are NOT skipped by the legacy gate (spineIsJsLike is
      the wrong predicate). Sharp reach quirks to pin (verified in-code):
      GENERATOR bodies never descend (the anchors early-return before their
      trailing recursion); class-DECL Constructor/SetAccessor bodies and
      class-DECL PropertyDeclaration initializers unreached while class-EXPR
      prop inits ARE reached; objlit SetAccessor bodies unreached; arrow
      CONCISE (expression) bodies never descend (both annotated and not);
      return/throw/export= EXPRESSIONS and if/while conditions and for
      headers unreached in statement position; GetAccessor sentinel body
      (pos == -1) skips. LANDED: anchors dispatch at LEAVE (the 17.135
      TS2304/TS2314 diagnostics-list probes must see the annotation's own
      spine emissions — enter-dispatch over-emitted TS2355 on exactly 2
      corpus tests); 19 pins (Inv4SpineBatch28Test); suite 11,170 → 11,189;

      TS2449/TS2450 + TS2454 co-emit + static-init TS2729) — 5-state reach
      classifier + per-list-owner memoized blockScopedDecls; the retained
      BOUNDED checkUBDForwardRefs walk anchors at DIRECT statements of
      activated lists (it recurses if/labeled itself — nested statements
      never re-anchor); loop-header self-ref checks re-host at For/ForIn/
      ForOf enters. TWO order couplings resolved by slot placement:
      populateAmbientCyclicBaseClasses (the TS2449 suppression-set producer)
      moved BEFORE the spine, and the TS2454 co-emits becoming visible to
      checkDefiniteAssignmentViaFlowGraph's dedup scan measured INERT
      (slot-move pre-gate: corpus green + listAll ×8 identical). Cross-file
      leg stays a separate pass at the spine slot. 33 pins

      TS2575) — the first DEPTH-valued reach classifier (the legacy
      argCountDepth recursion counter reproduced per edge, ≤200 cap; binary
      right-spine absorption = no depth) and the first MAP-valued pull-based
      downward context (funcParams/ctorParams/fnDepth/superCtor rebuilt at
      each emission from per-list-owner memoized levels — sound because every
      list overlay reads its WHOLE statement list). TRAP: a pull rebuild that
      RE-ENTERS itself through its own memoized levels must reuse its shared
      ascent buffer MARK-based, never clear()-based (the for-of loop-shadow
      edge silently dropped; one pin caught it). Producer sibling
      checkSpreadNonIterableIntoFixedArity moved BEFORE the spine. 46 pins

    - (w5) DONE round 534 (2026-07-16): checkDefiniteAssignment (the SET-based
      TS2454 pass) — the first per-statement-LIST ordered walker with a
      DOWNWARD leak context: legacy list activations become CORE FRAMES
      (pushed at SourceFile/fn-body/Block/ModuleBlock owners, per-statement
      steps at direct-child enters — the collect/checkUses/mark/nestedLeak
      loop body retained verbatim), the recursion walkers become a memoized
      10-state ancestor classifier (spineDaStatus/spineDaEdge), and the
      downward leak set is READ from the top frame's per-statement
      currentLeak via LEAK-flavored statuses (sound: leak-preserving paths
      never cross a core spawn). The flow-graph siblings (ViaFlowGraph
      dedups one-directionally against this pass) moved to right after the
      spine, preserving set-pass-first order; slot-move pre-gate ×8
      identical. 39 pins (Inv4SpineBatch25Test) pre-verified on the OLD
      walker; suite 11,052 → 11,091; listAll error-line identical on ALL 8
      profiles; ~370 walker lines deleted. See the round-534 session note.
    - (w4) DONE round 533 (2026-07-16): checkDuplicateIdentifiers (TS2300
      family) — the lightest (d) shape: STATELESS (the two
      checkDuplicateDeclarations flags derive at the anchor) and ZERO-TYPING,
      so the migration is a pure boolean reach classifier
      ([spineDupIdReached] over [spineDupIdEdge], the deleted
      checkDuplicatesInStatement(s)/InExpr/InClassElement arms verbatim) +
      anchor dispatch at node enters running the RETAINED bounded leaf
      utilities; class/objlit MEMBER emissions dispatch uniformly at the

      SetAccessor/Constructor is class-only). Per-file top-level scans ride
      checkSpine's loop in the legacy within-file order, each wrapped in a
      currentFileLocals=null install (the legacy pass ran with it null —
      checkClassNamespacePrototypeConflict's `?: globals` consult makes it

  - [ ] **INV.4(e) The top-3 giants.** checkPropertyAccess (3.66 s @ round-542
    table) → checkTypeAssignability (2.62 s) → checkCallExpressionTypes
    (2.13 s) — one at a time (together ~38% of checker-init; 458k of 595k
    getTypeOfExpression calls). **g1 SUB-PLAN (scouted round 542, in-code):
    checkPropertyAccess's walker core is compact (checkPropertyAccessInStatement
    293 lines / 22 arms + checkPropertyAccessInExpr 414 lines / 26 arms —
    the mass is in the called emission machinery, retained as leaf
    utilities). State model per the (d) templates: (1) statement-ordered
    currentLocalTypes recordings (w2 arith shape — PUSH-maintained frames,
    PASS-PRIVATE on the spine per the w2 currentParamBindingNames lesson;
    the pass also does applyBodyLocalShadowing at fn-decl/arrow/fn-expr
    boundaries per the round-447 gotcha — those calls stay in the frame
    installs); (2) contextualType downward threading with clear-before-body
    edges (w3 iany shape — push ctx with frames at exactly the legacy
    assignment edges); (3) enclosingClassType threaded param + inStaticClassMethod
    (pull-derivable from the member chain); (4) propertyAccessEnclosingNamespaces
    (its OWN stack, deliberately separate from inferenceNamespaceStack per
    the two-stacks gotcha — push at ModuleDeclaration edges); (5) per-file
    ambient currentFileLocals/currentCheckFileName/currentFlowGraph/
    currentLexicalScopes (per-dispatch install, w1 discipline — NOTE
    currentFlowGraph walk-wide is the 78-test hazard, so install around
    emissions only). SUB-STEPS, one commit each: (g1a) slot-move pre-gate —
    move the intact pass from its slot to the spine slot; this REORDERS it
    before the other two giants, so expect residue coupling (the w2
    corpus-only lesson): listAll ×8 + FULL corpus mandatory; if the
    pre-gate diffs, bisect the coupling with restore-after-pass probes
    before any migration. (g1b) pins (~50, the largest batch yet — reach
    quirks per arm; pre-verify on OLD). (g1c) the migration. (g1d) after
    g1 lands, re-measure; g2/g3 decompose the same way when reached.**
    **g1a MEASURED (round 542, both experiment directions run and REVERTED —
    the working tree keeps the legacy giant order): the giants are
    order-entangled in BOTH directions, and the couplings are CORPUS-ONLY
    (all 8 profiles sorted-error-line-identical in both experiments).
    (1) checkPropertyAccess moved before checkTypeAssignability →
    noImplicitAnyForIn loses a TS7053: the element-access receiver's type
    (`var k1 = x[i]` → `{}`) comes from the assignability walk's
    currentLocalTypes RESIDUE — the w2 residue class; fix = the pass records
    its own receiver types (w2's own-recording template).
    (2) checkTypeAssignability moved to the spine slot →
    typeArgumentDefaultUsesConstraintOnCircularDefault's TS2353 display
    flips `Test<any>` → `Test` (aliasDisplayMap/declaredTypes first-touch)
    AND relationComplexityError gains 2 FP TS2322 (relation-cache/
    complexity-budget state) — CACHE first-touch couplings against the small
    passes between the spine and slot 64, each needing a root-cause before
    the giant can move. NEXT STEP for g1: bisect WHICH intermediate pass's
    first-touch the two failures depend on (binary-search the slot
    position), then either neutralize the dependency (pass-own state /
    explicit cache warm) or migrate the giant IN PLACE (dispatch from the
    spine but buffer emissions to the legacy slot — a new template).**
    **g1a BISECT COMPLETE (round 543) — STRATEGIC FINDING, the (e) tier is
    BLOCKED ON INV.5: three targeted probes pinned both g1a' couplings to
    exactly TWO small producer passes (checkTypeParameterDefaults — its
    first-touch of the circular-default alias caches the `Test<any>`
    display; checkTemplateUnionIntersectionComplexity — its TS2859
    complexity verdicts make the giant's relation SKIP the failing
    comparison), but applying the established producer-move pattern (both
    before the spine + the giant at the spine slot) dragged a coupling
    CHAIN: 5 NEW generic-family corpus failures
    (genericsWithoutTypeParameters1, genericRecursiveImplicitConstructor-
    Errors3, noTypeArgumentOnReturnType1, conflictingTypeParameterSymbol-
    Transfer, returnTypeTypeArguments) + a harness listAll diff — the moved
    producers have their OWN upstream first-touch dependencies. Buffered
    emission does not help either: the COMPUTATION (type resolution into
    shared caches) is what is order-sensitive, not the emission. CONCLUSION:
    the giants cannot migrate by slot manipulation while nodeTypes/
    declaredTypes/aliasDisplayMap/relation caches are first-touch-order-
    sensitive. The (e) tier's prerequisite is INV.5's cache re-keying
    (`nodeTypes` keyed (node, mapper) — always valid; canonical type
    identity), which makes resolution order-INSENSITIVE. RE-SEQUENCED:
    work INV.5 next; return to (e) when the caches are order-free. All
    probe edits REVERTED — the tree keeps the legacy giant order.**
    **SUPERSEDED (rounds 555/556): the 542/543 conclusions above are STALE —
    the probe/slot-move scripts matched a COMMENT containing
    `pass("checkSpine")` and inserted the giant ~100 passes early (see the
    round-555 CLAUDE.md gotcha), so the "coupling chain" / "blocked on
    INV.5" findings were position artifacts (possibly compounded — the
    INV.5 (a)/(c)/(d1)/(e) landings since may also have genuinely
    order-freed some caches). At the CORRECT position, with exactly the two
    round-543 producers hoisted (landed round 555), ALL THREE giants
    slot-moved to the spine block corpus-green + listAll-×8-identical
    (landed round 556; legacy relative order g-cta → g-cpa → g-ccet
    preserved). g1a/slot-move pre-gates: DONE for all three. (g1b) DONE
    rounds 557/558 — 33 reach pins (Inv4SpineG1PinsTest statement arms,
    Inv4SpineG1PinsExprTest expression arms), all verified on the current
    walker.**
    **(g1c) DESIGN (round 559, from the g1b arm reads): the migration ORDER
    must be cta FIRST — the giants share a CROSS-PASS residue channel:
    checkPropertyAccess's driver does NOT reset currentLocalTypes per file,
    so it consumes checkTypeAssignability's recordings (round 542's
    noImplicitAnyForIn TS7053 finding: the `var k1 = x[i]` receiver type is
    cta residue). Migrating cpa into the spine FIRST would run its per-node
    work BEFORE the still-slot-resident cta → the residue disappears.
    Migrating cta first preserves cta-before-cpa; note per-node
    interleaving ≠ pass-after-pass for BACKWARD residue reads (a node
    consuming a LATER node's recording) — the pass-after-pass semantics let
    cpa see cta's COMPLETE final state incl. later files; audit any
    backward consumption during the cta migration (candidate remedy: the
    w2 own-recording template — each pass records what it consumes).
    Frame model per the INV.4(d) playbook: (1) per-dispatch ambient install
    of currentFlowGraph/currentLexicalScopes (NEVER walk-wide on the spine
    — the 78-test hazard; the legacy walk-wide set is reproduced by
    installing around every g1 emission); (2) fn-like scope copies
    (fn-decl/method/ctor/set-accessor/arrow/fn-expr) as push-frames at
    body enters (save map refs, install copies + populateParameterLocalTypes
    + applyBodyLocalShadowing/applyAmbiguousBlockScopedLocals), popped at
    leaves — GetAccessor bodies deliberately have NO scope copy (chunk-1
    pin); (3) contextualType as a kinded downward carrier at call-arg /
    objlit-property / arrow-body edges (the w3 template; cleared at
    fn-expr body and spread edges); (4) propertyAccessEnclosingNamespaces
    pushed at non-declare ModuleDeclaration enters; (5) enclosingClassType
    as a pull-derived member-chain context (null across fn-decl/fn-expr
    boundaries, KEPT through arrows — chunk-2 pins), with the this-param
    override at method enters; (6) inStaticClassMethod save/set/restore at
    class-member enters; (7) currentEnclosingEnum at EnumDeclaration
    enters; (8) reach quirks as classifier edges: for-INIT unreached,
    tagged-template spans unreached, interface bodies unreached,
    shorthand-property initializers unreached.**
    **(g2 = cpa DECOMPOSITION, queued round 576 — the cta migration (rounds
    560–576, m1..m3m) is COMPLETE for the emission surface; work these
    top-to-bottom, one commit each, mirroring the proven cta sequence):**
    - [x] **(cpa-m1) Legacy-side audit instrumentation** — DONE round 577. (the cta-m2a
      pattern): a test-only `cpaAuditRecord` at the top of
      checkPropertyAccessInStatement fingerprinting the threaded+ambient
      context per DIRECT statement — enclosingClassType (threaded param),
      currentLocalTypes/currentParamBindingNames/currentEnumConstrainedParams/
      currentShadowedNames (fn-boundary copies), inStaticClassMethod,
      propertyAccessEnclosingNamespaces depth, contextualType. FINGERPRINT
      HAZARD (scouted): cpa's currentLocalTypes maps name→Type, not strings
      like cta's varTypes — Type.id is resolution-order-sensitive between
      legacy-time and spine-time, so fingerprint by sorted name set +
      per-name typeToString (test-only cost), never by id.
    - [x] **(cpa-m2-prep) Close the residue channel legacy-side** — DONE
      round 578: per-file `currentLocalTypes` reset in the cpa driver + the
      element-access own-recording; corpus green + listAll ×8 byte-identical.
    - [x] **(cpa-m2) Spine-side frame skeleton** — COMPLETE round 580 (tier 2:
      unified edge-reach walker, arrow/fn-expr/ClassExpression frames,
      cpaCtxAt/cpaEctAt; full bidirectional audit equality).
      tier 1 (statements) DONE round 579 ((cpa-m2a): fn-decl/method/ctor/
      accessor frames, ns frames, loop-var overrides, per-decl-leave
      recordings, the immediate-position fingerprint gate); REMAINING
      (cpa-m2b): tier 2 — DESIGN COMPLETE (scouted round 579b, in-code):
      (i) arrow Block-body frames: 3-map copy + populate + shadowing +
      ambiguous + contextual param registration from ctx-at-arrow;
      ect/inStatic PRESERVED through arrows; (ii) fn-expr body frames:
      3-map copy + the fn-expr's OWN param semantics (annotated -> set,
      UN-annotated -> REMOVE from localTypes — not populate!) +
      destructured-name collection + contextual registration + shadowing +
      ambiguous; body walks with ect = NULL; (iii) ClassExpression member
      bodies: the tier-1 class-member frames extended to ClassExpression
      owners with a per-visit synthetic anon-class type (display
      "(Anonymous class)" — fingerprint-equal across fresh synthetics);
      (iv) ctx PULL-derivation cpaCtxAt(node): STOP-null at any statement
      edge; DEFINE at call-arg (the argCtxTypes computation: single-sig +
      B86.1b inference mapper + literal mapper; multi-sig strictSelect /
      every-overload-callable), objlit PropertyAssignment initializer
      (propCtx from ctx(O).members, non-any/error else null), SpreadAssignment
      (null), arrow EXPRESSION body (bodyCtx = single-sig return); INHERIT
      through paren/conditional/binary/array-literal/template-span/as/
      nonnull/prefix/postfix/await/spread AND NewExpression args (a legacy
      quirk: new's args inherit the OUTER ctx — no clearing); ctx is
      provably NULL at every statement dispatch (arrow Block bodies get
      bodyCtx=null; fn-exprs null explicitly); (v) the tier-2 chain test
      needs an expression-edge REACH classifier (the spineUResExprEdge
      pattern) — legacy expr-walk quirks: TaggedTemplate walks the TAG only
      (spans unreached), ForStatement INITIALIZER unreached (condition +
      incrementor reached), ForIn/ForOf initializer AND iterable expression
      unreached (ForOf's getTypeOfExpression is not a walk), decorators
      unreached, objlit METHOD bodies unreached (else -> {}),
      ShorthandPropertyAssignment unreached, CommaList unreached,
      arrow/fn-expr PARAM DEFAULTS unreached; statement-edge expression
      roots: Var initializers / ExprStmt / Return / If condition / While-Do
      condition / Switch subject + case exprs / Throw / With /
      ExportAssignment / Enum member inits / Class heritage + members.
      (the cta-m2b/m2c pattern — expect quirk-extraction cycles; the known
      quirks from the g1c design: GetAccessor bodies have NO scope copy,
      enclosingClassType is KEPT through arrows / nulled at fn-decl+fn-expr
      boundaries, contextualType clears before bodies, the pass is
      PASS-PRIVATE for currentParamBindingNames per the w2 lesson, and the
      driver does NOT reset currentLocalTypes per file — cpa consumes cta
      RESIDUE cross-file (round-542 noImplicitAnyForIn TS7053), which the
      frames must reproduce or own-record).
    - [x] **(cpa-m3…) Emission moves** — COMPLETE rounds 581-583; **(cpa-retire)
      LANDED round 585: the checkPropertyAccess legacy pass is DELETED** (the
      first giant off emit-twice; audit scaffolding removed with it).
    - [x] **(cta-retire) LANDED round 586: the checkTypeAssignability legacy
      pass is DELETED** (both migrated giants off emit-twice; audit
      scaffolding removed).
    **(g3 = ccet DECOMPOSITION, queued round 588 from the in-code scout —
    the LAST giant; mirror the twice-proven cpa sequence, one commit each):**
    - [x] **(ccet-m1) State-model scout — COMPLETE round 588b.** Additional
      facts: the expr walker has NO contextualType channel (plain recursion);
      arrow/fn-expr arms copy 2 maps (localTypes+paramBindings) + register
      own params anyType + Block-body shadowing; the ObjectLiteral arm does
      a SCOPED localTypes copy around member walks; EMISSIONS ARE
      PER-CALL-NODE (checkSingleCallExpressionTypes at CallExpressions,
      checkSingleNewExpressionTypes at NewExpressions) — so the m3 anchor is
      per-Call/New-node at ITS OWN LEAVE (the probe discipline), with frames
      supplying ambient; no emit-via-containing-walk ownership complication
      (nested-fn-body calls anchor at their own nodes under spine-maintained
      frames). DECISION: pins-first — NO fingerprint audit (CcetAnchorTest
      exactly-once pins + corpus/listAll gates; the audit pattern's quirk
      extraction is replaced by the gates, which caught all three cpa-m3a
      quirks anyway).
      ORIGINAL ITEM: **(ccet-m1) State-model scout completion + audit-or-pins decision.**
      Scouted so far (in-code, round 588): the driver resets currentLocalTypes
      per file since round 584 (residue-free); FunctionDeclaration arm copies
      currentLocalTypes + currentParamBindingNames AND pushes the fn's OWN
      TPs onto currentTypeParamScope (constraint materialization included),
      then populateParameterLocalTypes + applyCallTypesBodyLocalShadowing +
      shadowNestedFunctionNames (the M1.11 ecology — presence-only consults,
      the first-touch cache-poisoning hazard is documented in the helpers);
      ClassDeclaration arm pushes class TPs + resolves the class symbol via
      globals ?: inferenceNamespaceStack.last().exports; ModuleDeclaration
      pushes inferenceNamespaceStack via resolveModuleDeclNamespaceSymbol
      (DOTTED namespaces handled — unlike cpa's arm); the IfStatement arm
      does a SCOPED single-name union-narrowing override (save/write/restore
      around the then-walk); the VariableStatement arm ORDER-RECORDS
      annotated-callable + B98.r126 + callable-shadow entries. REMAINING to
      scout: the expr walker's arms (contextual channels?), the class-member
      dispatch, funcParams/currentFunctionParams overlay production, and
      currentEnclosingEnum/classForThis usage. DECISION POINT: rounds
      585/586 showed the audits end as deleted scaffolding — consider going
      pins-first (CcetAnchorTest exactly-once) + frame-skeleton-with-
      corpus-gates instead of the full fingerprint audit; the audit earned
      its keep on cta/cpa quirk EXTRACTION, so keep it only if the frame
      skeleton's first corpus gates diff untraceably.
    - [ ] **(ccet-m2) Spine-side frame skeleton — FULL SPEC (round 588c
      in-code read of every arm):** CcetFrame fields: localTypes(HashMap) +
      paramBindings(HashSet) [copied at fn-decl/method/ctor/contextual-fn
      boundaries + arrow/fn-expr expr-arms], tpScope+tpAst [fn-decl pushes
      OWN TPs with interning + constraint materialization; class arm pushes
      the DECLARED class type's TPs resolved via
      globals ?: inferenceNamespaceStack.last().exports; STATIC methods POP
      the class scope but mint FRESH TPs for their own typeParameters],
      superBaseSig/superBaseType [ctor gets both, method gets Type only —
      from the per-class baseResolution computed under the class TP scope],
      nsSymbol [ModuleDeclaration arm, NON-declare only, dotted-aware via
      resolveModuleDeclNamespaceSymbol], classSym [callWalkerClassStack
      push], the method-body `this` registration [instance methods:
      currentLocalTypes["this"] = getDeclaredTypeOfSymbol(classSym)],
      GetAccessor/SetAccessor bodies walk with NO copies. Var-arm ORDERED
      recordings (interleaved with initializer walks — the cta interleave
      lesson): callable-annotated + union-of-callables + literal-union +
      callable-shadow anyType; the B246 CONTEXTUAL fn-expr channel
      (FunctionType-annotated var + fn-expr/arrow init → params typed from
      the annotation with ?-undefined unions — a frame VARIANT, replaces
      the plain initializer walk); the If-arm SCOPED type-guard narrowing
      override (resolveUserTypeGuardNarrowing at the If enter, save/write/
      restore around the then — the cta-m3i narrowing-frame precedent);
      ForIn/ForOf withForLoopVarShadow around bodies. REACH QUIRKS (differ
      from BOTH prior giants): For-INITIALIZER expressions ARE walked
      (decl initializers + expression form); param DEFAULT initializers ARE
      walked at fn-decl/method/ctor arms (BEFORE the body frame — under the
      OUTER ambient); DoStatement walks body BEFORE condition;
      declare-module bodies are SKIPPED entirely (Declare gate — unlike
      cpa); DOTTED namespace bodies are RECURSED (unlike cpa);
      heritage expressions walk UNDER the class TP scope + class stack;
      objlit arm does a scoped localTypes copy. There is also a
      maxCheckDepth recursion guard (callTypeCheckDepth) at the statement
      dispatcher — reproduce as an int-valued reach cap if fidelity
      requires (the round-535 spineArgDepth precedent).
    - [ ] **(ccet-m3…) Emission moves** with the leave-dispatch discipline
      (cpa's probe lesson: anchor at statement/expression LEAVES) + the
      recorded-set truncation, then **(ccet-retire)** via the round-585
      experiment template (no-op the dispatch → gates → delete).
  - [ ] **INV.4(f) The two unlocked soundness wins.** Once one authoritative
    walk state exists: the per-node expression-type cache (594,779 calls over
    ~221,844 distinct nodes = ×2.6 recompute), and flow narrowing folded into
    reference typing once (84,469 depth-0 walks, 68% from property access).
    Re-measure against the ≤10 s single-threaded compiler-profile target.
- [ ] **INV.5 Canonical types + explicit instantiation** (absorbs M5.2/M5.3;
  NOW THE ACTIVE ARC ITEM — the round-543 g1a bisect proved the INV.4(e)
  giants are blocked on exactly this: first-touch-order-sensitive shared
  caches). Decomposed round 544, one commit each, every step suite +
  listAll-×8 gated:
  - [x] **INV.5(a) Union/intersection interning.** DONE round 545 (see the session note — landed with the ternaryOfArrayLiterals gate extension after the round-544 near-miss). `getUnionType` (Checker.kt
    ~103k, "mints a fresh Type.Union(sorted) with a new id — does NOT
    intern") + `getIntersectionType` intern by sorted member-id key (the
    `referenceCache` pattern; preserves display member order by keeping the
    FIRST-built instance). Directly serves order-insensitivity: an interned
    union has the same id regardless of which pass builds it first. KNOWN
    HAZARDS (from the gotcha corpus): (1) aliasDisplayMap is id-keyed — an
    interned union SHARED across contexts must not receive one context's
    alias name (the singleton-intrinsic display-corruption hazard
    generalized; union alias display already has the structural
    `unionAliasStructural` map — union registrations in aliasDisplayMap may
    need to move there entirely); (2) the id-only dedup gotcha (duplicate
    structurally-identical members) is UNCHANGED by interning — do not
    conflate the two; (3) the round-424 structural wash-gate workaround
    stays correct (it stops RELYING on fresh ids but never assumed them);
    (4) relation-cache/cycle-stack behavior only gains hits (same-id
    identical pairs). Verify: suite + listAll ×8 + re-run the round-542/543
    probe experiments to measure how much of the giant entanglement
    dissolves.
    **FIRST ATTEMPT (round 544, REVERTED): a minimal interning of both
    canonical constructors (CheckerState caches by member-id key; unions by
    sorted order, intersections in-order) measured CORPUS 100% GREEN
    (11,243/0) with EXACTLY ONE new FP, identical on all 8 profiles —
    watch.ts:533:19 TS2322 `(string | DiagnosticMessage)[]` ⊄
    `DiagnosticAndArguments` (the round-446 VARIADIC-TUPLE alias family).
    Remarkably contained for a change canonicalizing every union in the
    program — the hazard list's display fears did NOT materialize; the one
    regression is a relation/suppression path keyed on union identity
    (candidates: a relation-cache FALSE shared across contexts, an id-keyed
    side channel hitting a shared instance, or the
    arrayLiteralSatisfiesTupleTarget suppression's engine fallback). NEXT:
    root-cause with a targeted probe (temporary Diagnostic-init stack-trace
    probe keyed on code=2322 + the watch.ts:533 start per the round-472
    recipe), fix the one path, re-land.**
    **PROBE RE-RUN (round 546, post-(a)): the g1a' couplings PERSIST under
    canonical union identity (both typeArgumentDefaultUsesConstraintOn-
    CircularDefault and relationComplexityError still fail with the giant at
    the spine slot; probe reverted). The residual first-touch sensitivity is
    NOT union-identity — it lives in declaredTypes/aliasDisplayMap
    resolution TIMING (the Test<any> display) and the relation/complexity
    verdict state — i.e. exactly the (b)/(c) territory (explicit mappers +
    keyed nodeTypes). The INV.5 sequencing holds; continue with (b).**
    **PROBE RE-RUN 2 (round 548b, post-(c)): both g1a' couplings STILL
    persist — the residual first-touch state is specifically (1)
    `declaredTypes` (SYMBOL-keyed alias resolutions — the Test<any>
    display; a different cache from nodeTypes) and (2) the TS2859
    relation/complexity verdict state. The giant unblock therefore needs a
    declaredTypes context-keying sibling of (c) plus a
    complexity-verdict-state audit — queue them as (c2)/(c3) when
    returning to the giants; the two probe tests
    (typeArgumentDefaultUsesConstraintOnCircularDefault,
    relationComplexityError) are the standing acceptance gate for any such
    step. Probe reverted.**
    **(c2) SCOUTED (round 549): the Test<any> coupling is a
    LAZY-MATERIALIZATION first-touch, not a cache-keying one —
    `Type.TypeParam.constraint`/`.default` are MUTABLE fields set at 8+
    scattered sites by whichever pass resolves the TP first (the
    typeParamInternCache shares the instance program-wide), so a no-args
    generic reference instantiates with defaults ONLY IF some earlier pass
    already materialized `.default`. DESIGN: EAGER TP materialization — one
    fixed init step (after globals merge, before any check pass) resolving
    every TypeParameter's constraint/default under its declaration's
    sibling-TP scope (the checkTpListDefaults scope-building pattern),
    making the fields order-free; the 8 lazy setters become no-ops
    (already-set guards) and eventually delete. Acceptance: the two probe
    tests + full gates.**
    **(c2) HYPOTHESIS FALSIFIED (round 549b, attempt REVERTED): a minimal
    eager top-level TP materialization (constraint+default fields filled at
    a fixed init point) did NOT dissolve the probe failure — the coupling's
    mechanism is the EFFECTIVE-default-via-constraint computation inside
    reference instantiation (the probe test's own name:
    typeArgumentDefaultUsesConstraintOnCircularDefault — tsc substitutes
    the CONSTRAINT when the default is circular), i.e. resolution-path
    state beyond the raw fields. Next root-cause step: instrument WHAT
    the legacy checkTpListDefaults slot changes that the later TS2353
    display consumes (candidate: the referenceCache entry for Test<any>
    minted during its constraint-relation checks, which the annotation
    resolution then reuses vs mints bare). Deferred behind (b2+)/other
    INV.5 work — the display-only coupling is cosmetic, not semantic.**
  - [ ] **INV.5(b) Explicit mapper objects.** Replace the ambient
    `currentTypeAliasArgs`/`currentTypeParamScope` instantiation contexts
    with an explicit mapper threaded through the resolution entry points —
    the enabler for (c). MEASURED SURFACE (round 546): 87 write sites in 34
    functions (top installers: checkCallTypesInStatement ×7,
    walkStmtsForTypeParamCasts ×6, checkReturnAssignability /
    resolveGenericPropertyTypeWorker / getTypeFromTypeReference /
    resolveInterfaceMembersCore / checkConstraintsInStatements ×4 each) +
    ~90 read sites inside the resolution family. DECOMPOSITION (bridge
    pattern — each step suite + listAll-×8 gated): (b1) a `TypeMapper`
    value (aliasArgs + tpScope + a stable fingerprint for cache keying) +
    an optional `mapper` param on `getTypeFromTypeNode`/
    `getTypeFromTypeReference` DEFAULTING to the ambient (behavior-
    identical bridge; the `cacheable` gate reads the param); (b2+) flip
    installer families to pass explicitly — (b2a) DONE round 549c: all 6
    simple aliasArgs installers flipped via aliasMapper/layeredAliasMapper
    (b2b) DONE round 549d: the remaining 3
    aliasArgs installers flipped too — alias substitution ~93.8k,
    constraint-retry ~89.6k, mapped-type per-key ~140.4k; the aliasArgs
    ambient is now single-writer (the bridge); tpScope families next);
    (b2c/b2c'-''', rounds 550a-550d) DONE: ALL resolution-internal tpScope
    installers flipped to the REGION form (`withInstantiationContext(
    scopeMapper(...)) { ... }` — inline, non-local returns preserved):
    resolveGenericPropertyTypeWorker (outer + inner method scope),
    resolveBaseTypesLazy, resolveInterfaceMembersCore (sig + index), the
    getTypeOf* lazies, buildBaseConstructorSignatureForSuper,
    buildSignatureForFunctionLikeTypeNode, reresolveSigParamsUnderClassScope,
    getTypeFromTypeLiteral's method branch, checkConstraintsForTypeArgs.
    REMAINING (deliberately deferred): the walker-level installers (die
    with INV.4(e)), the dual-ambient-field installers
    (checkConstraintsInStatements + currentTypeParamDecls;
    checkMixinClassInStatements + mixinValueScope), the 84067 interleaved
    implicit-any site, and the paired pushFunctionTypeParamsScope; (bN)
    remove the ambient fields (blocked on those). NOTE (c) only needs the mapper AT THE CACHE CONSULT — it can
    start right after (b1) with ambient-bridged installers still in place
    (key = (nodeId, mapper.fingerprint); the context-bypass `cacheable`
    rule dies there).
  - [x] **INV.5(c) `nodeTypes` keyed (node, mapper) — LANDED round 548
    (option iii — the conservative pinned-checking-file gate; see the
    session note; widen the gate as INV.3(d) retires checking-file-dependent
    resolution, and cache the fingerprint per-install if the +5.4%
    single-run wall cost proves real).** Kills
    the context-bypass rule and the first-touch hazard class outright (the
    round-543 blocker). DESIGN (scouted round 547b — the surface is TINY,
    exactly 2 use sites inside getTypeFromTypeNode): a SECOND cache
    (`mappedNodeTypes`) for context-bearing resolutions keyed by an
    IDENTITY node key (=== equality with nodeId-based hashCode — cross-file
    nodeId collisions only share buckets, never results; unindexed nodes
    skip) + a context fingerprint (ns-stack symbol ids + sorted tpScope
    name:id pairs + sorted aliasArgs name:id pairs). The existing
    empty-context cache and its isPerFileDependentRefNode bypass stay
    untouched (identity keys make that hazard structurally impossible in
    the NEW cache). **SOUNDNESS CONSTRAINT (the reason this is not yet
    implemented): context-bearing resolutions ALSO depend on the CHECKING
    file — `currentFileLocals?.get ?: globals` consults are
    checking-file-keyed (the conflation ecology), so a fingerprint that
    excludes that dimension re-creates the first-touch disease inside the
    cache. Either (i) include a reliable checking-file identity in the
    fingerprint (currentCheckFileName is a stale-prone proxy — audit the
    setters first), or (ii) wait for INV.3(d)'s completion to eliminate
    checking-file-dependent resolution, or (iii) start with a
    CONSERVATIVE fingerprint that additionally requires
    currentFileLocals === the node's owning file's locals (node-keyed
    consult, cheap via owningSourceFile with a per-file memo) and skips
    caching otherwise.** Option (iii) is self-validating and incremental —
    preferred.
  - [ ] **INV.5(d) Instantiated members cached ON the `Type.Reference`.**
    Delete `resolveGenericPropertyType` fresh-minting + its depth-4 OOM cap
    (the per-recursion-level cache-miss gotcha). **(d1) DONE round 552: the
    depth-4 cap is DELETED — replaced by the per-top-level-relation
    instantiation budget + the param-side foreign-TP gate in
    tryEmitObjectVsNamedUnionArg (see the session note). Remaining: the
    member-table-on-reference allocation redesign ((d2), optional now that
    the budget bounds allocation) and the fresh-minting deletion.**
    **CAP-LIFT PROBE FALSIFIED (round 551, reverted): removing
    `relationDepth < 4` with (a)-interning + the (ref.id, prop.id) memo in
    place still KILLS performanceComparisonOfStructurallyIdentical-
    InterfacesWithGenericSignatures — the deep-stack thread dies after ~20 s
    (OOM → NPE at runWithDeepStack's result unwrap). The blowup is BREADTH,
    not depth: each comparison level mints genuinely NEW (target, args)
    references (growing arg shapes), so the memo never hits and the
    deeply-nested 5-occurrence heuristic (which fires at relation ENTRY)
    doesn't bound the per-level member/signature instantiation between
    bails. The real (d) fix is tsc-shaped: an instantiation-count budget
    (tsc's instantiationDepth/instantiationCount → TS2589) plus member
    tables cached ON the reference, NOT a cap lift. Keep the depth-4 cap
    until then.**
    **BUDGETED-LIFT PROBE (round 551b, also reverted): a per-top-level-
    relation budget of 2,000 fresh worker computations (reset at depth-0
    relation entry, consumed on memo miss, raw fallback on trip) TAMES the
    perf-bomb — corpus fully green 11,252/0 — but exposes exactly ONE new
    FP on all 8 profiles: program.ts:2924 TS2345 `(readonly Diagnostic[] |
    undefined)[]` ⊄ `T[][] | readonly (T | …)[]` (tsc's flatten<T> — the
    documented M3.1 masked gap: tsc infers T, we don't, and the old
    depth-≥4 trivial-pass masked it). A TP-free gate on DEEP substitution
    results does NOT kill it — the outcome flips inside the relation
    (target side), not at the substitution result. VERDICT: the cap
    deletion is blocked on generic inference (M3.1) / the (e)-era
    engine-opening work, not on allocation strategy — sequence (d) with
    (e), and consider a param-side foreign-TP bail at the call-arg
    emission as the enabling slice (corpus-gated; the round-431 gate
    family's rationale applies verbatim to un-inferred PARAM types).**
  - [ ] **INV.5(e) Open `canUseTypeEngine`'s generic gate; delete superseded
    pin walkers** (suite-gated per deletion). Then RETURN to INV.4(e).
    **FIRST HALF DONE round 553: the hasUnresolvedTypeParams skip is
    DELETED (corpus + listAll ×8 identical; the Box<T>-vs-Box<string>
    false negative now fires — Inv5GenericGateTest). Remaining: the
    pin-walker deletion sweep.**

- [ ] **INV.6 Parallelism** (absorbs M5.4). Share-nothing checker workers per
  `docs/parallel-caching.md` (trivially partitionable once INV.4 gives a per-file
  check entry); parallel emit on Default + IO write sink; deterministic partition +
  merge via the existing diagnostic sort. Structured concurrency from INV.1.
- [ ] **INV.7 Productization** (absorbs M5.5/M5.6). Native re-enable (the big-input
  GC inversion should largely dissolve post INV.4/5); watch mode driven by a
  file-event Flow; `.tsbuildinfo`-style incremental reuse.

Numeric targets (proposed, doc § 6): post INV.4/5 single-threaded compiler profile
≤ 10 s (≈ JS tsc) + harness RSS ≤ 1 GB; post INV.6 compiler ≤ 5 s on 4 cores;
INV.7 stretch: native cold ≤ 2× tsgo.

### Post-v1 backlog — the "any TypeScript project" horizon (parked 2026-07-03)

The top-to-bottom loop SKIPS this section until v1 (the 8 tsc-source profiles at zero
FPs) lands. None of these block self-compiling tsc. Each returns to the live queue
when v1 lands — or earlier if a live item genuinely needs one (promote per protocol,
with a session note saying why). Item IDs are stable; session notes reference them.

- [ ] **M2.4 DOM libs as an opt-in set** (dom.generated.d.ts is 1 MB+ — measure the
  parse/bind cost; ties into the shared-snapshot design). tsc's sources don't
  reference DOM — post-v1.
- [ ] **M3.0 Conformance generator extension.** Extend `generateTypeScriptTests` with
  a per-category allowlist for `tests/cases/conformance/` (5,907 files; keep all tsgo
  set-B filters). Start with the categories matching M3.1 (types/typeParameters,
  types/typeRelationships, expressions/functions). Each category lands only when its
  failures are triaged into queue items — never leave a category half-red without
  notes. Owner approval (2026-07-02) stands; optionally pull in early as an extra
  regression net if an M3 campaign wants the coverage.
- [ ] **M3.5 Per-file scopes** (Blocker #3: stop merging all file locals into
  `globals`; per-file scope construction with explicit import visibility). Revisit
  before v1 ONLY if dashboard FPs trace to cross-file scope conflation on tsc sources.
- [ ] **M4.1 Full nodenext resolution**: package.json `exports`/`imports` maps,
  symlink/realpath (pnpm layouts), `typesVersions`, package self-references. (The tsc
  repo itself uses relative imports + @types — unused for v1.)
- [ ] **M4.2 Real declaration emitter.** `.d.ts` output for arbitrary code (the corpus
  strips most `.d.ts` sections, so almost none exists today; `declaration: true` is
  table stakes for "any project"). Test bed: conformance decl baselines + self-compile
  d.ts diffing. Pull into v1 only if the owner defines "fully compile tsc" to include
  declaration output.
- [ ] **M4.3 JSX end-to-end** (`jsx: react-jsx`/`react`/`preserve` transforms on real
  React-shaped code).
- [ ] **M4.4 External sourcemaps** (`.js.map` files; inline maps exist).
- [ ] **M4.5 Decision point**: project references / composite / incremental scope
  (tsgo supports them; needed for large monorepos — decide build vs defer with owner).
- [ ] **M4.6 `package.json "type": "module"` module-format detection in
  `ProjectCompiler`** (found compiling zod, 2026-07-07): under `module: NodeNext`
  with a `"type": "module"` package.json, real tsc emits ESM but we emit CJS — the
  `collectPackageJsonTypes` machinery exists only for the multi-file TEST-source path
  and is not wired into the on-disk project pipeline. Repro: zod (see M4.7); the
  emitted CJS only runs in a `"type": "commonjs"` context. Unused for v1 (the
  tsc-source bench project has no package.json → CJS default is correct there).
- [ ] **M4.7 zod as a second dashboard profile** (validated 2026-07-07, round 432
  session note): shallow-clone `github.com/colinhacks/zod`, compile
  `packages/zod/src` (107 files, ~31k LOC) via a `tsconfig.xtsc.json` extending zod's
  real `.configs/tsconfig.base.json` (strict, exactOptionalPropertyTypes,
  noUnusedLocals, NodeNext), include `src/**/*.ts`, exclude tests/benchmarks — real
  tsc 6.0.3 reports 0 errors on it, so every xtsc diagnostic is an FP. Baseline
  2026-07-07: 1,665 FPs (top: TS7006×447 contextual params, TS2694×284 namespace
  members via `export *` barrels, TS7029×211 switch-fallthrough, TS2344×182), 0
  crashes, all 107 files emit, output passes a runtime smoke test. Complements the
  tsc-source profiles: stresses generic method chaining + noFallthroughCasesInSwitch,
  which tsc's own source doesn't.

### Offline asset inventory (verified 2026-07-02)

- `typescript-repo` object DB is complete (sparse checkout, full objects): any
  `src/**` path extractable via `git archive HEAD <path>`; `src/lib/` holds the 110
  real lib `.d.ts` files; `tests/cases/conformance/` holds 5,907 `.ts`/`.tsx` cases.
- Node/tsc/tsgo are NOT currently installed — differential testing (M0 optional) and
  real `@types/node` (M1.3) wait for network.
- The benchmark project cache lives under `build/bench/` (cheap to rebuild); results
  TSVs under `bench/` (gitignored, machine-specific).

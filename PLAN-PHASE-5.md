# PLAN-PHASE-5 — Real-world compilation, then performance

Owner directive (2026-07-02): *"I want this compiler to be able to fully compile any
TypeScript project. Then I want to also optimize the performance."*

This file is the **live queue** for Phase 17. `PLAN-PHASE-4.md` (Phase 16 and earlier)
is archived state — its "Known architectural blockers" section remains the reference
material for the M3 items below; do not work its queue.

## Phase 17 — Real-world compilation (M0–M5)

(Live session notes accumulate here, most recent first — same convention as Phase 16.)

**Round 385 (2026-07-03) — P0 services hang FIXED (flow-walker memoization + budgets);
asserts-parse stub discovered; M0.2 baselines completed 8/8.**
The hang was the predicted exponential re-entry with a twist: `narrowByAssertCall`
resolved every visited FlowCall's callee (PropertyAccess receiver typing →
`getNarrowedTypeForReference` re-entry per call, no memoization anywhere) — and
because `parseType()`'s AssertsKeyword branch ERASES `asserts x is T` to bare `T`
(`TypePredicate.assertsModifier` is never constructed), ALL of that exponential work
was spent discovering "not a predicate" every time; assert narrowing has been inert
since round 43 built it. Fix (349dc97b) mirrors tsc checker.ts, four pieces:
(1) arg-path pre-check in `narrowByAssertCall`/`narrowByCallPredicate` — bail before
any callee resolution unless some argument's reference path IS the walked name;
(2) per-outermost-request callee-decl memo (`narrowWalkDeclCache`, tsc
`links.effectsSignature` — request-scoped for cross-pass safety); (3) per-invocation
flow-node memo (tsc `sharedFlowNodes`) with the depth-conditional serve rule
`depth <= cachedDepth` + clean-subtree-only stores that keep narrowing byte-identical
under the NARROW_MAX_DEPTH truncation; (4) live-depth (2000, tsc `flowDepth`) +
cumulative-visit budgets shared across re-entries via the `narrowLiveDepth` FIELD
(== 0 ⇔ outermost request = reset point). **Budget sizing lesson (40d33b58): near the
NARROW_MAX_DEPTH horizon subtree results are inherently entry-depth-dependent — no
identity-preserving memo can serve them — so depth-skewed diamond chains in giant tsc
functions legitimately need 6-figure visit counts; the first 50k budget truncated one
such walk and GREW the dashboard (TS18048 41→42 → compiler profile 4,485). The final
1M budget (probes: 50k → 4,485/101.8 s, 200k → 4,485/139.1 s, 1M → 4,484/187.1 s)
recovers exact pre-fix diagnostics.** Benches: compiler pre-fix 289.9 s → 187.1 s
(−35.5% at exact 4,484; the memo win is larger at looser compliance points — 101.8 s
at the 50k budget); services HUNG (killed after 30+ CPU-min frozen in one statement)
→ 563.4 s / 7,173 errors / 1,226 MB (7,174→7,173: the 1M budget recovers one narrowing
there too); server FIRST baseline 627.4 s / 7,634 errors / 1,139 MB (274 files);
harness FIRST baseline 592.7 s / 8,164 errors / 1,920 MB (312 files) — **M0.2 crash
gate 8/8 profiles green, zero crashes/OOMs anywhere.** Local
AssertNarrowingScalingTest pins the invariant: the exact services shape (N=120
property-chain assert-style calls whose args mention both walked paths, ≈2^120 walker
visits pre-fix) → 0.125 s, plus negative/positive controls proving `x is T` predicate
narrowing still applies through the memoized path. NEW: M1.5 queued (activate asserts
predicates end-to-end — parser + tsc condition-arg narrowing; the arg-path pre-check
must WIDEN to path-containment, never be deleted). M1.2 updated: its tsc-flowDepth
mechanism now exists as these budget fields; what remains is the TS2563
emission/suppression semantics. **Same session, M1.2a landed (3c4cb60b): B399 records
`cfaTooLargeFiles` and an end-of-init filter removes every TS2454 in them (tsc's
flowAnalysisDisabled emits TS2563 OR TS2454, never both; real tsc emits neither on
its own sources) — self-compile 4,484 → 4,464 (−20, exactly the predicted knock-ons),
compile time unchanged; CfaTooLargeBailTest pins both directions (small CFG: same
never-assigned-read shape MUST fire TS2454; too-large CFG: TS2563 present, TS2454
suppressed). The M1.2 remainder (TS2563 per-container semantics) is re-scoped in the
queue item — it is gated on NARROW_MAX_DEPTH removal (largeControlFlowGraph's
baseline REQUIRES TS2563, but faithful walk-exhaustion semantics need walks to reach
depth 2000, which the 50-cap prevents) and overlaps M3.4.** Full suite 8,861 / 0 / 3
(+5 local tests this round).

**Round 384 (continued) — M0.2 findings + M1.1 landed: self-compile 13,245 → 4,484 (−66%).**
M0.2 (`--project all`): 5/8 profiles green in ~5 min each with tightly clustered
baselines (compiler 13,245; tsc-cli 13,247; jsTyping 13,301; deprecatedCompat 13,256;
typingsInstallerCore 13,348 — TS2305 dominating each at 8,752–8,837), zero
exceptions/OOMs; **services HUNG → the P0 now at the queue top** (30+ CPU-min frozen in
one `checkVarDeclAssignability`; stack: `narrowByAssertCall` → callee/arg type
resolution → `getNarrowedTypeForReference` re-entry per assert-call flow node, no
memoization — tsc's services code is `Debug.assert`-dense); server/harness deferred.
Also caught: the src/tsc profile's TSV name collided with the compiler profile's
historical file (fixed, `self-compile-tsc-cli.tsv`). **M1.1** (8a4ba245): export-star
barrel following — measured **13,245 → 4,484 (−8,761)**, TS2305 eliminated from the
top codes, compile −2.7%; remaining top families now TS7006×1554 (contextual-typing
gaps → M3.2), TS2339×886, TS2322×827, TS2345×543, TS7030×114, TS2769×77. **M1.2 recon**
(for the P0 + M1.2 implementer): tsc's mechanism confirmed at checker.ts:29037 —
`flowDepth === 2000` counts recursive `getTypeAtFlowNode` invocations per
`getFlowTypeOfReference` walk (linear single-antecedent steps are the iterative
`while(true)` loop and don't consume budget; `sharedFlowNodes` memoizes shared nodes
per walk), `flowAnalysisDisabled` is checker-global but save/restored around each
function-or-module block in `checkBlock` (= container-scoped), and
`reportFlowControlError` anchors at `findAncestor(reference, isFunctionOrModuleBlock)
.statements.pos` token span. Our B399 per-file node-count heuristic must be replaced by
that walk-budget + per-walk memoization — which is ALSO the P0 fix.

**Round 384 (2026-07-03) — M0.1 + M0.3 landed; M0.2 baseline running.**
M0.1 (9b5bcd78): `--project` profiles + per-project TSVs in the bench script (see QUEUE
entry). M0.3 (f85cc438): parse-based specifier extraction — the parser now records
`SourceFile.moduleSpecifiers` at the real parse sites (static/dynamic/require/import-type
plus a new bounded leading-trivia scan for `/// <reference>` that honors directives after
a block-comment header, which `checkTripleSlashSelfReference`'s corpus-pinned scan does
not); `ProjectCompiler.extractSpecifiers` parses instead of regex-scanning, so
string-literal/comment/regex-literal text can no longer fabricate unresolved imports or
pull junk files into the program. 6 local tests pin the invariant (garbage never
extracted; deep-nested dynamic imports found; string-literal mention neither reaches
`unresolved` nor joins the program). Suite 8,848 / 0 / 3 (+6 local). Session ops notes:
a leftover bench run from round 383 was still executing at session start (its TSV row
landed at 23:08 — labels tell them apart); my first services verification run was killed
as polluted (its gradle step compiled pre-M0.3 code, then the M0.3 recompile swapped
class files under the running JVM — don't recompile while a bench JVM is up). M0.2
`--project all` relaunched clean on f85cc438; expected effect on compiler profile:
errors stay exactly 13,245 (extraction doesn't affect checking), unresolved drops from
120 to just node-builtin bare specifiers (env-legit until M1.3).

### Mission & strategy

Three strategic reads that shape everything below:

1. **Compliance and performance are the same road for the first 90%.** We run
   ~26 kLOC/s on corpus-shaped code but ~0.7 kLOC/s on tsc's own source — the 40× gap
   IS the false-positive paths (wasted relation checks, elaboration-chain construction,
   hundreds of per-file pin walkers). Killing FPs is the biggest available perf
   optimization, which is why "fully compile first, optimize second" is also the
   correct engineering order.
2. **The pin-walker strategy won Phase 16 and cannot win Phase 17.** Corpus-unique
   suppress-and-reemit walkers were rational for byte-exact baseline matching;
   arbitrary code never matches their gates. Phase 17's core is replacing pinned
   behavior with the real engine — with the green corpus as a permanent regression
   net, and pins **deleted** as the engine supersedes them (each deletion suite-gated,
   in the same commit as the superseding feature when practical).
3. **You cannot steer without a real-world metric.** The corpus count is saturated at
   100%; the Phase 17 dashboard is per-project FP counts, emit diffs, crash count, and
   throughput. `scripts/bench-compile-tsc.sh` + `bench/*.tsv` are the seed.

### Ground rules (delta vs Phase 16)

- The corpus suite stays a **hard zero-regression gate** forever: full suite green
  before every commit (`rm -rf build/test-results/jvmTest/binary && ./gradlew jvmTest`).
- The **success metric is the dashboard** (below), not the corpus count. STATUS.md
  tracks both.
- **Local corner-case tests per fix** (Phase 16 protocol step 2) still applies.
- **Never-crash doctrine**: any crash/hang/OOM on any input is a P0 — insert a repro
  item at the top of the queue.
- **Pins are deletable**: when an engine feature makes a corpus-unique walker
  redundant, delete the walker (suite-gated). Track net walker count in session notes.
- Everything else in CLAUDE.md § "Execution protocol" (promote-unblocker default,
  one-commit-per-substep, session notes, trim-on-write, guardrails) applies unchanged.

### Approvals granted by the owner (2026-07-02, "the last mile" → this plan)

- **Conformance-suite adoption** (test-generation change): extend
  `generateTypeScriptTests` to `tests/cases/conformance/<category>` subsets, staged
  per category, keeping the tsgo set-B filters (incl. `tsconfigInTestUsesRemovedFeature`).
- **Real-lib migration**: replace the embedded simplified lib with the real
  `typescript-repo/src/lib/*.d.ts` files (110 files, verified present offline).
- **Differential testing against real tsc** (network needed): install node +
  typescript@6.x when available; vendor real projects (zod etc.) as fixtures.
- Still user-gated: Gradle/dependency changes beyond these scopes; re-enabling the
  native target build config is pre-approved as part of M5.

### The dashboard

| Metric | Source | Phase 17 target |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus suite | jvmTest XMLs | green forever (8,842 / 0 / 3 at phase start; 8,856 with local tests as of round 384) |
| Self-compile FPs (tsc src/compiler) | `bench/self-compile-tsc.tsv` | 13,245 → 0 (**4,484 after M1.1**; 43 are env-legit until M1.3) |
| Project corpus FPs (services/server/…) | `bench/` TSVs (M0.1) | 0 |
| Conformance adoption | generated-test counts per category | all tsgo-relevant categories green |
| Crashes on any input | bench runs | 0 |
| Throughput (self-compile) | `bench/self-compile-tsc.tsv` | ≥ corpus-shaped ~26 kLOC/s (M5: numeric targets vs tsc/tsgo) |

### QUEUE — work top-to-bottom; promote unblockers per protocol

- [x] **P0 — services-profile compile hang: exponential narrowing re-entry.** DONE
  (round 385, 349dc97b + 40d33b58): the predicted re-entry exponential, with a twist —
  `parseType()`'s AssertsKeyword branch ERASES `asserts x is T` to bare `T`
  (`TypePredicate.assertsModifier` is never constructed), so ALL the exponential
  callee-resolution work concluded "not a predicate" every time (assert narrowing has
  been inert since round 43 → M1.5). Fix mirrors tsc checker.ts: arg-path pre-check
  before any callee resolution; per-outermost-request callee-decl memo
  (`narrowWalkDeclCache`, tsc `links.effectsSignature`); per-invocation flow-node memo
  (tsc `sharedFlowNodes`) with the `depth <= cachedDepth` serve rule + clean-only
  stores (byte-identical to pre-fix truncation semantics); live-depth (2000, tsc
  `flowDepth`) + 1M cumulative-visit budgets shared across re-entries via the
  `narrowLiveDepth` field. services: hang → 563 s / 7,173 errors; compiler profile
  byte-identical 4,484 at −35.8% compile time; server + harness first baselines landed
  (M0.2 now 8/8). AssertNarrowingScalingTest pins the invariant (N=120 of the exact
  re-entry shape ≈2^120 visits pre-fix → 0.125 s; controls prove `x is T` narrowing
  still applies). See the round-385 session note + CLAUDE.md gotchas for the budget
  sizing lesson (50k truncated a legitimate walk and grew the dashboard by one FP).

**M0 — Real-world measurement rig**

- [x] **M0.1 Project-corpus runner.** DONE (9b5bcd78): `--project` profiles in
  `bench-compile-tsc.sh` — compiler/tsc/jsTyping/deprecatedCompat/typingsInstallerCore/
  services/server/harness (each = named dir + transitive tsconfig-references closure,
  flattened) or `all`/comma-list; per-project TSVs (`self-compile-<name>.tsv`,
  compiler keeps the historical `self-compile-tsc.tsv`); per-project log subdirs +
  multi-project overview table.
- [x] **M0.2 Crash/robustness gate.** DONE (round 384; completed 8/8 in round 385) —
  the gate ran and did its job: round 384 got 5/8 profiles green with tightly-clustered
  baselines (compiler 13,245 err / 298 s; tsc-cli 13,247 / 297 s; jsTyping 13,301 /
  304 s; deprecatedCompat 13,256 / 296 s; typingsInstallerCore 13,348 / 292 s — TS2305
  dominating pre-M1.1; rows in bench/*.tsv), zero exceptions/OOMs; **services HUNG →
  became the P0** (killed after 30+ CPU-min frozen in one statement). Round 385 (P0
  fixed) completed the remaining baselines: services 563 s / 7,173 err / 1,226 MB;
  server 627 s / 7,634 err / 1,139 MB; harness 593 s / 8,164 err / 1,920 MB — all
  files emitted, zero crashes anywhere; same FP families across profiles
  (TS2339/TS7006/TS2345/TS2322 ≈ 85% of every profile's count). Also caught an M0.1
  bug: the src/tsc profile logged into the compiler profile's historical TSV — fixed
  (fabca29d, self-compile-tsc-cli.tsv).
- [x] **M0.3 Fix ProjectCompiler dynamic-import specifier extraction.** DONE
  (f85cc438): the parser records specifiers at the real parse sites into
  `SourceFile.moduleSpecifiers` (tsc's `SourceFile.imports`) — static import/export-from,
  import-equals require, dynamic `import()`/`require()` string-literal calls at any
  depth, `import("...")` types, triple-slash path/types from leading trivia;
  `extractSpecifiers` parses instead of regex-scanning. 6 local tests
  (ModuleSpecifierExtractionTest). Known FN: JSDoc `@type {import("x")}` in .js (no
  structural JSDoc model) — revisit with M4.

**M1 — Kill the systematic FP families**

- [x] **M1.1 TS2305 export-star barrel following.** DONE (8a4ba245): measured
  **13,245 → 4,484 self-compile errors (−8,761, −66%)**, TS2305 gone from the top-codes
  list, compile −2.7% for free. `getModuleExportsFollowingStars` (cycle-guarded,
  depth-bounded, memoized per top-level file; NULL = unknowable → callers skip absence
  emission for non-default names — FN-safe) wired into TS2305/2459/2460/2614/2724 +
  TS2613's upgrade; `export * as ns` contributes its name; re-export branch gained the
  import branch's `.js`→`.ts` fallback; `getModuleAllExports` deleted. 8 local tests.
  Suite 8,856 / 0 / 3, zero regressions.
- [ ] **M1.2 TS2563 per-container CFA rule (−27 TS2563 remaining).** Replace the
  per-FILE >2000-flow-node heuristic (B399, Checker init) with tsc's per-container
  flow-depth rule. **The TS2454 half is DONE (M1.2a, round 385): B399 records
  `cfaTooLargeFiles` and an end-of-init filter removes every TS2454 in them (tsc's
  flowAnalysisDisabled emits TS2563 OR TS2454, never both) — CfaTooLargeBailTest pins
  it both ways.** The TS2563 half is HARDER than the recon suggested: faithful
  per-walk-exhaustion semantics require the walk to actually REACH depth 2000, but
  NARROW_MAX_DEPTH=50 silently truncates far earlier — so `largeControlFlowGraph`
  (whose baseline REQUIRES TS2563) would stop firing under a naive swap. The real
  scope is NARROW_MAX_DEPTH removal (deeper narrowing corpus-wide, baseline churn
  likely) + tsc-shaped budget consumption (linear steps free) + TS2563 on genuine
  walk exhaustion — the round-385 budget fields (`narrowLiveDepth`/
  `NARROW_GLOBAL_DEPTH_BUDGET`/`narrowVisitsLeft`) are the mechanism to build on.
  Overlaps M3.4; consider folding into it.
- [ ] **M1.5 Activate `asserts` predicates end-to-end (found by the P0, round 385).**
  `parseType()`'s AssertsKeyword branch is a STUB that erases `asserts x is T` to bare
  `T` and `asserts x` to void — `TypePredicate.assertsModifier` is never constructed, so
  `narrowByAssertCall` (and every assertsModifier consumer) is dead code, and tsc-style
  `Debug.assertIsDefined(x)` guards narrow nothing (a real-world FP source: code after
  the assert keeps `T | undefined`). Work: parser `TypePredicate(assertsModifier=true)`
  (audit the ~5 consumer sites incl. the `"asserts "` display at Checker.kt ~127892;
  corpus assert-family tests may shift), then extend `narrowByAssertCall` beyond
  direct-arg matching to tsc's condition-arg narrowing (`Debug.assert(x !== undefined)`
  narrows by the CONDITION) — which requires WIDENING the round-385 arg-path pre-check
  to path-containment, never deleting it (the services-perf firewall gotcha).
- [ ] **M1.3 `types` / `typeRoots` / `@types` resolution.** Implement the tsconfig
  `types` field and `node_modules/@types/*` acquisition in ProjectCompiler/
  ModuleResolver (this is a real-project requirement regardless of the benchmark).
  Offline caveat: real `@types/node` is not on disk — add an optional `--node-stub`
  flag to the bench script materializing a minimal ambient stub (`require`, `process`,
  `fs`/`path`/`perf_hooks`/`inspector` modules) so the self-compile count can reach 0;
  keep the no-stub run as the honest default until network provides real `@types/node`.
- [ ] **M1.4 Re-measure + strategic map.** Full project-corpus bench run; record the
  new per-family FP baseline in a session note; re-rank the remaining families (the
  ~3,100 TS7006/TS2339/TS2322/TS2345 checker-modeling tail) and insert the top 2–3 as
  concrete queue items here.

**M2 — Real-lib migration (staged; decompose further at start)**

- [ ] **M2.1 Lib graph loader.** Parse + bind the real `typescript-repo/src/lib/*.d.ts`
  selected per `target`/`lib` (the `/// <reference lib="…" />` DAG: lib.es2020 →
  es2019 + es2020.* pieces), as a process-wide immutable snapshot parsed ONCE and
  shared across programs (this snapshot is deliberately the seed of M5's incremental
  infra). Behind a CompilerOptions flag so corpus A/B comparison is possible.
- [ ] **M2.2 Corpus A/B and default flip.** Run the corpus with real libs; burn down
  the diff (baselines were produced by real-lib tsc, so divergence generally means one
  of our compensating hardcodes — fix by deletion). Flip the default when green.
- [ ] **M2.3 Unwind lib-divergence pins.** Grep anchors: `LIB_MIN_TARGET`,
  `LIB_MIN_TARGET_SOFT`, `BUILTIN_LIB_VALUE_INTERFACES`, `KNOWN_GLOBALS` (derive from
  the loaded libs), the hardcoded Date TS2740 message, hardcoded "and N more" counts,
  hardcoded overload chains copied from baselines (`WEAKSET_2769_CHAIN` etc.),
  `libFeatureAvailable`. Delete `BUILTIN_LIB_SOURCE` last.
- [ ] **M2.4 DOM libs as an opt-in set** (dom.generated.d.ts is 1 MB+ — measure the
  parse/bind cost; ties into the shared-snapshot design).

**M3 — Type-engine completion, conformance-driven (the long pole; each item
decomposes into a multi-session campaign — read PLAN-PHASE-4.md § "Known architectural
blockers" for accumulated detail before starting)**

- [ ] **M3.0 Conformance generator extension.** Extend `generateTypeScriptTests` with
  a per-category allowlist for `tests/cases/conformance/` (5,907 files; keep all tsgo
  set-B filters). Start with the categories matching M3.1 (types/typeParameters,
  types/typeRelationships, expressions/functions). Each category lands only when its
  failures are triaged into queue items — never leave a category half-red without notes.
- [ ] **M3.1 Generic instantiation + call-site inference** (remove the
  `hasUnresolvedTypeParams` relation bail; real type-argument inference incl.
  contextual return positions). This is the documented #1 engine blocker.
- [ ] **M3.2 Contextual typing engine** (parameters, returns, object/array literals,
  generic-context propagation — replaces `applyContextualParamTypesForArrow`-era
  special cases).
- [ ] **M3.3 Mapped / conditional / template-literal / indexed-access evaluation**
  (replace the AST-shape walkers; delete the superseded dedicated walkers and pins).
- [ ] **M3.4 Flow narrowing unified into identifier typing** (`getTypeOfIdentifier`
  consults the flow graph; retire the per-consumer narrowing carve-outs).
- [ ] **M3.5 Per-file scopes** (Blocker #3: stop merging all file locals into
  `globals`; per-file scope construction with explicit import visibility).

**M4 — Ecosystem completeness (interleaves with late M3)**

- [ ] **M4.1 Full nodenext resolution**: package.json `exports`/`imports` maps,
  symlink/realpath (pnpm layouts), `typesVersions`, package self-references.
- [ ] **M4.2 Real declaration emitter.** `.d.ts` output for arbitrary code (the corpus
  strips most `.d.ts` sections, so almost none exists today; `declaration: true` is
  table stakes for "any project"). Test bed: conformance decl baselines + self-compile
  d.ts diffing.
- [ ] **M4.3 JSX end-to-end** (`jsx: react-jsx`/`react`/`preserve` transforms on real
  React-shaped code).
- [ ] **M4.4 External sourcemaps** (`.js.map` files; inline maps exist).
- [ ] **M4.5 Decision point**: project references / composite / incremental scope
  (tsgo supports them; needed for large monorepos — decide build vs defer with owner).

**M5 — Performance (starts only when the project corpus compiles clean)**

- [ ] **M5.1 Profiling grid**: JFR/async-profiler over the project corpus (cold CLI,
  warm in-process via BenchMain, RSS); publish flamegraph findings in a session note
  before optimizing anything.
- [ ] **M5.2 Allocation discipline in the relation engine** (type interning /
  canonicalization — replace the documented fresh-mint caps like the
  `getPropertyTypeForRelation` depth bound with proper sharing).
- [ ] **M5.3 Cache effectiveness under scope contexts** (today `nodeTypes` is bypassed
  whenever any resolution context is active = recompute on every generic-heavy path).
- [ ] **M5.4 Parallel per-file checking** via the existing-but-unused `CheckerPool`
  (LinkStore side-tables already keep binder output immutable for this).
- [ ] **M5.5 Incremental compilation** (`.tsbuildinfo`-style reuse; the M2.1 shared
  lib snapshot is the first piece).
- [ ] **M5.6 Native target re-enable + tune** (linuxX64 was disabled in c7e3535f;
  native already wins <10 kLOC — fix the big-input inversion, likely GC/allocation).
- [ ] **M5.7 Numeric targets** (proposed; confirm with owner at M5 start): warm ≥ tsc
  throughput on 500k-LOC real code; cold CLI ≤ 1.5× tsc on medium projects; RSS ≤ tsc;
  stretch: approach tsgo on native.

### Offline asset inventory (verified 2026-07-02)

- `typescript-repo` object DB is complete (sparse checkout, full objects): any
  `src/**` path extractable via `git archive HEAD <path>`; `src/lib/` holds the 110
  real lib `.d.ts` files; `tests/cases/conformance/` holds 5,907 `.ts`/`.tsx` cases.
- Node/tsc/tsgo are NOT currently installed — differential testing (M0 optional) and
  real `@types/node` (M1.3) wait for network.
- The benchmark project cache lives under `build/bench/` (cheap to rebuild); results
  TSVs under `bench/` (gitignored, machine-specific).

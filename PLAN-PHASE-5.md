# PLAN-PHASE-5 — Real-world compilation, then performance

Owner directive (2026-07-02): *"I want this compiler to be able to fully compile any
TypeScript project. Then I want to also optimize the performance."*

This file is the **live queue** for Phase 17. `PLAN-PHASE-4.md` (Phase 16 and earlier)
is archived state — its "Known architectural blockers" section remains the reference
material for the M3 items below; do not work its queue.

## Phase 17 — Real-world compilation (M0–M5)

(Live session notes accumulate here, most recent first — same convention as Phase 16.)

**Round 387 (2026-07-03) — M1.3 landed: tsconfig `types`/`typeRoots`/@types acquisition
+ bench `--node-stub`. Self-compile: no-stub control EXACTLY 4,456 (acquisition inert
under `types: []`); stub run 4,456 → 4,411 (−45 env-legit, zero new codes). Suite
8,888 / 0 / 3 (+9 local).** Mechanics: `ProjectCompiler.collectTypeRootEntries` +
`effectiveTypeRoots` (explicit roots REPLACE the walk-up `node_modules/@types`
default) + `ModuleResolver.resolveTypeRootPackage` (package.json `types`/`typings`,
else `index.d.ts` — deliberately narrower than directory resolution: no `main`, no
runtime `index.*`); entries seed the graph walk so their imports and
`/// <reference types>` directives follow; TS2688 for explicitly-requested-but-missing
names only. TypesAcquisitionTest pins the sharp both-ways invariant with
ambient-global-only packages (only acquisition can reach them → inclusion = global
resolves + entry in programFiles; exclusion = TS2304). Two findings worth keeping:
(1) the first stub cut declared `Buffer` value-only and sys.ts's `let buffer: Buffer;`
drew TS2749 — a node global that doubles as a type needs the lib wrapper-type shape
(generic-tolerant `interface Buffer<T = any>` MERGED with the var via canMerge
Variable+Interface; harness even writes `Buffer<ArrayBuffer>`, hence the defaulted
type param). (2) Resolving the 46 env-legit names FREED the global 10-lookup TS2552
suggestion budget: the 5 `SetIterator`/`MapIterator` sites (es2024 collection-iterator
types missing from the embedded lib — an M2 lib-gap marker; 4×TS2552 + 1×TS2304 in the
control) all became TS2552 — diagnostics SHAPES can shift when unrelated names start
resolving, so compare by-code diffs against the freed-budget effect before calling a
+1 a regression. Ops: two mid-session cwd drifts (a `cd` into the bench dir made
relative-path XML reads report 0 files — a false "no tests ran" scare; absolute paths
resolved it). **Same session, M1.4 (re-measure + strategic map): fresh no-stub rows at
2254d13c — services 7,173 → 7,145 err / 563 → 393 s (−30%); server 7,634 → 7,606 /
627 → 383 s (−39%); harness 8,164 → 8,135 / 593 → 392 s (−34%, RSS 1,920 → 1,192 MB).
The ~−28 error deltas are round 386's narrowing work; the time/RSS drop is the
depth-2000 memo effect; each profile also gains M1.2b's +2 completed-narrowing TS2345
(same shape as utilities.ts:11604/11859). Family map from the 4,411-site compiler
`--listAll`: TS7006×1554 is 52% ONE FILE (visitorPublic.ts ×810 — the
`VisitEachChildTable` computed-enum-key mapped-type table) plus the factory pattern
(checker.ts ×318 `return { isUndefinedSymbol: symbol => … }` ← return-annotation
member fn types; program.ts ×94; tsbuildPublic.ts ×63) → M1.6. TS2345×65 + TS2322×~35
are ONE relation bug (`undefined` ≁ union CONTAINING undefined:
`PunctuationToken<any> | undefined`, `VisitResult<Node | undefined>`) and TS2339×44 is
`new Map<K, V>()` typing the local as MapConstructor → M1.7. TS7030×114 are
`T | undefined`-returning functions drawing our strict-only TS7030 where tsc requires
noImplicitReturns → M1.8. TS2339's dominant bucket (461 union receivers + the named
`Type`/tuple sites — `isTypeParameterDeclaration(node) ? node.name…`,
`isGenericTupleType(type) && type.target…`) is user-type-guard narrowing on the big
merged AST unions → absorbed into M3.4's item text. `SetIterator`/`MapIterator`
(es2024) and String.replace's RegExp-arg overload (TS2345 `'RegExp'`→`'string'` ×19)
→ M2 markers. On services/server/harness, TS2339 (1,741–1,904) overtakes TS7006 as
the #1 family — the M3.4 narrowing bucket dominates the bigger profiles.**

**Round 386 (2026-07-03) — M1.2 closed: narrowing depth horizon 50→2000 (zero corpus
churn), TS2563 half folded into M3.4 with measurement; M1.5 asserts predicates ACTIVE
end-to-end; M1.5b falsified-and-pinned; assignment-effect narrowing landed.
Self-compile: 4,464 → 4,456 errors, 185.8 → 75.8 s (−59%), RSS 1,166 → 853 MB.**
M1.2b: the flagged blocker ("corpus depends on depth-50 truncation") was measured
EMPTY — one-constant experiment, full suite 8,861/0/3 at depth 2000 — and the cap
itself turned out to be the round-385 perf problem's other half: truncated subtrees
are never memo-stored (clean-only rule), so the 50-cap forced deep-CFG walks to
recompute everything; lifting it alone took the compiler profile 185.8 → 68.3 s and
RSS 1,166 → 841 MB at byte-identical diagnostics EXCEPT +2 TS2345
(utilities.ts:11604/11859 — deeper walks now COMPLETE two narrowings whose results an
arg-check consumer turns into FPs; the depth-50 truncation had been hiding them;
tracked under M1.4). TS2563-emission folded into M3.4 after reading
largeControlFlowGraph: it is 10k sequential `data[0] = 0` statements — tsc's TS2563
fires because USE-SITE reference typing walks the evolving array's flow at every
mutation check (flow-based identifier typing = M3.4's exact capability); none of our
four narrowing consumers ever walks that file deep, so a faithful walk-exhaustion
emitter is unreachable until then and B399's per-file heuristic (+ its 27 self-compile
TS2563 FPs) stays. **M1.5 (eaa27a90)**: parser builds `TypePredicate(assertsModifier=
true)`; asserts returns are void (return-less bodied assert fns draw no TS2355/2366/
7030); `narrowByAssertCall` live — `is T` targets, `is NonNullable<T>` as nullish
exclusion, bare `asserts cond` by CONDITION via `applyConditionNarrowing` (the
`Debug.assert(x !== undefined)` shape); the round-385 pre-check widened to
path-containment (`argMentionsReferencePath` — iterative, bails open; the firewall
stays); `resolveFlowCalleeDecl` gains namespace-member callee resolution
(`resolveNamespaceMemberFnDecl`); `callHasTypeGuardArg` gates `!assertsModifier`.
8 local tests with negative controls (AssertsPredicateActivationTest); suite
8,869/0/3. **Self-compile M1.5 delta is only TS2344 −2 + TS2355 −1 — the assert
NARROWING moved nothing on tsc sources** (TS2339/TS18048 unchanged): the imported
`Debug` alias apparently doesn't resolve to debug.ts's namespace through the
`_namespaces/ts.ts` export-star barrel in the flow-callee path → new M1.5b queue item.
Also landed: `--listAll` CLI flag (full diagnostic lists for run-to-run FP diffing —
used to isolate every delta above). **Same session, the M1.5b pivot + assignment-effect
narrowing (482e9ad1 + 8f246dcf): self-compile 4,463 → 4,456 (TS18048 41 → 34).**
M1.5b's hypothesis was falsified BY TEST before building anything — a ProjectCompiler
repro of tsc's exact barrel topology narrows correctly (3 pinning tests,
AssertsBarrelResolutionTest) — and sampling the real TS18048 FPs showed ASSIGNMENT
shapes instead (`context.pragmas = new Map() as PragmaMap` then use;
`result.extendedSourceFiles ??= new Set()`). Landed `narrowByAssignmentRhs` (shared by
both walker mirrors): structurally-non-nullish-RHS exclusion for `=`/`??=`/`||=` on
identifier + property-path targets (`&&=` excluded and pinned), cheap pre-gates before
path building; Flow.kt binds FlowAssignment for COMPOUND assigns on property LHS (the
only real binder gap — plain `=` property targets already had nodes). Cost: compile
68.6 → 75.8 s (+10%, the per-FlowAssignment matcher; still −59% vs the session's
185.8 s start — revisit in M5). Suite 8,879 / 0 / 3 (+10 local this arc). **Process
lessons, armored in comments/memory: (1) a STALE walker comment ("no FlowAssignment
for property paths") led to a duplicate `when` arm in bindAssignmentTarget that
SHADOWED the real arm (Kotlin takes the first match), dropped the LHS read-records,
and regressed this-before-super + instanceof narrowing (narrowingOfDottedNames,
checkSuperCallBeforeThisAccessing2) — the commit initially landed on a FALSE-GREEN
garbled notification and was amended after a filesystem-verified rerun. (2)
Background-task/Monitor payloads were unreliable ALL session — fabricated bench
summaries citing nonexistent log dirs, two different "12-char" expansions of one sha,
a BUILD SUCCESSFUL while the worker was mid-run, `-s`-gated monitors firing on empty
files — every gate now reads test XMLs / TSVs / logs from disk only (memory:
background-task-verification.md). (3) Hit CLAUDE.md's №1 gotcha verbatim: an
`until ! pgrep -f GradleWorkerMain` poller matches ITSELF — the bench sat behind it
for 10 minutes.** Ops notes from earlier in the session, superseded by the above:
one bench overlapped a concurrently launched attribution JVM (contaminated row
deleted); never run a second JVM while a bench measures.

**Round 385 (2026-07-03) — P0 services hang FIXED (flow-walker memoization + budgets);
asserts-parse stub discovered; M0.2 baselines completed 8/8.**
The hang was the predicted exponential re-entry with a twist: `narrowByAssertCall`
resolved every visited FlowCall's callee (PropertyAccess receiver typing →
`getNarrowedTypeForReference` re-entry per call, no memoization anywhere) — and
because `parseType()`'s AssertsKeyword branch ERASES `asserts x is T` to bare `T`
(`TypePredicate.assertsModifier` is never constructed), ALL of that exponential work
was spent discovering "not a predicate" every time; assert narrowing has been inert
since round 43 built it. Fix (349dc97b) mirrors tsc checker.ts, four pieces:
(1) arg-path pre-check in `narrowByAssertCall`/`narrowByCallPredicate` — bail before
any callee resolution unless some argument's reference path IS the walked name;
(2) per-outermost-request callee-decl memo (`narrowWalkDeclCache`, tsc
`links.effectsSignature` — request-scoped for cross-pass safety); (3) per-invocation
flow-node memo (tsc `sharedFlowNodes`) with the depth-conditional serve rule
`depth <= cachedDepth` + clean-subtree-only stores that keep narrowing byte-identical
under the NARROW_MAX_DEPTH truncation; (4) live-depth (2000, tsc `flowDepth`) +
cumulative-visit budgets shared across re-entries via the `narrowLiveDepth` FIELD
(== 0 ⇔ outermost request = reset point). **Budget sizing lesson (40d33b58): near the
NARROW_MAX_DEPTH horizon subtree results are inherently entry-depth-dependent — no
identity-preserving memo can serve them — so depth-skewed diamond chains in giant tsc
functions legitimately need 6-figure visit counts; the first 50k budget truncated one
such walk and GREW the dashboard (TS18048 41→42 → compiler profile 4,485). The final
1M budget (probes: 50k → 4,485/101.8 s, 200k → 4,485/139.1 s, 1M → 4,484/187.1 s)
recovers exact pre-fix diagnostics.** Benches: compiler pre-fix 289.9 s → 187.1 s
(−35.5% at exact 4,484; the memo win is larger at looser compliance points — 101.8 s
at the 50k budget); services HUNG (killed after 30+ CPU-min frozen in one statement)
→ 563.4 s / 7,173 errors / 1,226 MB (7,174→7,173: the 1M budget recovers one narrowing
there too); server FIRST baseline 627.4 s / 7,634 errors / 1,139 MB (274 files);
harness FIRST baseline 592.7 s / 8,164 errors / 1,920 MB (312 files) — **M0.2 crash
gate 8/8 profiles green, zero crashes/OOMs anywhere.** Local
AssertNarrowingScalingTest pins the invariant: the exact services shape (N=120
property-chain assert-style calls whose args mention both walked paths, ≈2^120 walker
visits pre-fix) → 0.125 s, plus negative/positive controls proving `x is T` predicate
narrowing still applies through the memoized path. NEW: M1.5 queued (activate asserts
predicates end-to-end — parser + tsc condition-arg narrowing; the arg-path pre-check
must WIDEN to path-containment, never be deleted). M1.2 updated: its tsc-flowDepth
mechanism now exists as these budget fields; what remains is the TS2563
emission/suppression semantics. **Same session, M1.2a landed (3c4cb60b): B399 records
`cfaTooLargeFiles` and an end-of-init filter removes every TS2454 in them (tsc's
flowAnalysisDisabled emits TS2563 OR TS2454, never both; real tsc emits neither on
its own sources) — self-compile 4,484 → 4,464 (−20, exactly the predicted knock-ons),
compile time unchanged; CfaTooLargeBailTest pins both directions (small CFG: same
never-assigned-read shape MUST fire TS2454; too-large CFG: TS2563 present, TS2454
suppressed). The M1.2 remainder (TS2563 per-container semantics) is re-scoped in the
queue item — it is gated on NARROW_MAX_DEPTH removal (largeControlFlowGraph's
baseline REQUIRES TS2563, but faithful walk-exhaustion semantics need walks to reach
depth 2000, which the 50-cap prevents) and overlaps M3.4.** Full suite 8,861 / 0 / 3
(+5 local tests this round).

**Round 384 (continued) — M0.2 findings + M1.1 landed: self-compile 13,245 → 4,484 (−66%).**
M0.2 (`--project all`): 5/8 profiles green in ~5 min each with tightly clustered
baselines (compiler 13,245; tsc-cli 13,247; jsTyping 13,301; deprecatedCompat 13,256;
typingsInstallerCore 13,348 — TS2305 dominating each at 8,752–8,837), zero
exceptions/OOMs; **services HUNG → the P0 now at the queue top** (30+ CPU-min frozen in
one `checkVarDeclAssignability`; stack: `narrowByAssertCall` → callee/arg type
resolution → `getNarrowedTypeForReference` re-entry per assert-call flow node, no
memoization — tsc's services code is `Debug.assert`-dense); server/harness deferred.
Also caught: the src/tsc profile's TSV name collided with the compiler profile's
historical file (fixed, `self-compile-tsc-cli.tsv`). **M1.1** (8a4ba245): export-star
barrel following — measured **13,245 → 4,484 (−8,761)**, TS2305 eliminated from the
top codes, compile −2.7%; remaining top families now TS7006×1554 (contextual-typing
gaps → M3.2), TS2339×886, TS2322×827, TS2345×543, TS7030×114, TS2769×77. **M1.2 recon**
(for the P0 + M1.2 implementer): tsc's mechanism confirmed at checker.ts:29037 —
`flowDepth === 2000` counts recursive `getTypeAtFlowNode` invocations per
`getFlowTypeOfReference` walk (linear single-antecedent steps are the iterative
`while(true)` loop and don't consume budget; `sharedFlowNodes` memoizes shared nodes
per walk), `flowAnalysisDisabled` is checker-global but save/restored around each
function-or-module block in `checkBlock` (= container-scoped), and
`reportFlowControlError` anchors at `findAncestor(reference, isFunctionOrModuleBlock)
.statements.pos` token span. Our B399 per-file node-count heuristic must be replaced by
that walk-budget + per-walk memoization — which is ALSO the P0 fix.

**Round 384 (2026-07-03) — M0.1 + M0.3 landed; M0.2 baseline running.**
M0.1 (9b5bcd78): `--project` profiles + per-project TSVs in the bench script (see QUEUE
entry). M0.3 (f85cc438): parse-based specifier extraction — the parser now records
`SourceFile.moduleSpecifiers` at the real parse sites (static/dynamic/require/import-type
plus a new bounded leading-trivia scan for `/// <reference>` that honors directives after
a block-comment header, which `checkTripleSlashSelfReference`'s corpus-pinned scan does
not); `ProjectCompiler.extractSpecifiers` parses instead of regex-scanning, so
string-literal/comment/regex-literal text can no longer fabricate unresolved imports or
pull junk files into the program. 6 local tests pin the invariant (garbage never
extracted; deep-nested dynamic imports found; string-literal mention neither reaches
`unresolved` nor joins the program). Suite 8,848 / 0 / 3 (+6 local). Session ops notes:
a leftover bench run from round 383 was still executing at session start (its TSV row
landed at 23:08 — labels tell them apart); my first services verification run was killed
as polluted (its gradle step compiled pre-M0.3 code, then the M0.3 recompile swapped
class files under the running JVM — don't recompile while a bench JVM is up). M0.2
`--project all` relaunched clean on f85cc438; expected effect on compiler profile:
errors stay exactly 13,245 (extraction doesn't affect checking), unresolved drops from
120 to just node-builtin bare specifiers (env-legit until M1.3).

### Mission & strategy

Three strategic reads that shape everything below:

1. **Compliance and performance are the same road for the first 90%.** We run
   ~26 kLOC/s on corpus-shaped code but ~0.7 kLOC/s on tsc's own source — the 40× gap
   IS the false-positive paths (wasted relation checks, elaboration-chain construction,
   hundreds of per-file pin walkers). Killing FPs is the biggest available perf
   optimization, which is why "fully compile first, optimize second" is also the
   correct engineering order.
2. **The pin-walker strategy won Phase 16 and cannot win Phase 17.** Corpus-unique
   suppress-and-reemit walkers were rational for byte-exact baseline matching;
   arbitrary code never matches their gates. Phase 17's core is replacing pinned
   behavior with the real engine — with the green corpus as a permanent regression
   net, and pins **deleted** as the engine supersedes them (each deletion suite-gated,
   in the same commit as the superseding feature when practical).
3. **You cannot steer without a real-world metric.** The corpus count is saturated at
   100%; the Phase 17 dashboard is per-project FP counts, emit diffs, crash count, and
   throughput. `scripts/bench-compile-tsc.sh` + `bench/*.tsv` are the seed.

### Ground rules (delta vs Phase 16)

- The corpus suite stays a **hard zero-regression gate** forever: full suite green
  before every commit (`rm -rf build/test-results/jvmTest/binary && ./gradlew jvmTest`).
- The **success metric is the dashboard** (below), not the corpus count. STATUS.md
  tracks both.
- **Local corner-case tests per fix** (Phase 16 protocol step 2) still applies.
- **Never-crash doctrine**: any crash/hang/OOM on any input is a P0 — insert a repro
  item at the top of the queue.
- **Pins are deletable**: when an engine feature makes a corpus-unique walker
  redundant, delete the walker (suite-gated). Track net walker count in session notes.
- Everything else in CLAUDE.md § "Execution protocol" (promote-unblocker default,
  one-commit-per-substep, session notes, trim-on-write, guardrails) applies unchanged.

### Approvals granted by the owner (2026-07-02, "the last mile" → this plan)

- **Conformance-suite adoption** (test-generation change): extend
  `generateTypeScriptTests` to `tests/cases/conformance/<category>` subsets, staged
  per category, keeping the tsgo set-B filters (incl. `tsconfigInTestUsesRemovedFeature`).
- **Real-lib migration**: replace the embedded simplified lib with the real
  `typescript-repo/src/lib/*.d.ts` files (110 files, verified present offline).
- **Differential testing against real tsc** (network needed): install node +
  typescript@6.x when available; vendor real projects (zod etc.) as fixtures.
- Still user-gated: Gradle/dependency changes beyond these scopes; re-enabling the
  native target build config is pre-approved as part of M5.

### The dashboard

| Metric | Source | Phase 17 target |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus suite | jvmTest XMLs | green forever (8,842 / 0 / 3 at phase start; 8,856 with local tests as of round 384) |
| Self-compile FPs (tsc src/compiler) | `bench/self-compile-tsc.tsv` | 13,245 → 0 (**4,456 after rounds 385–386; 4,411 with `--node-stub`** — M1.3 resolved the env-legit family; no-stub stays the honest default) |
| Project corpus FPs (services/server/…) | `bench/` TSVs (M0.1) | 0 |
| Conformance adoption | generated-test counts per category | all tsgo-relevant categories green |
| Crashes on any input | bench runs | 0 |
| Throughput (self-compile) | `bench/self-compile-tsc.tsv` | ≥ corpus-shaped ~26 kLOC/s (M5: numeric targets vs tsc/tsgo) |

### QUEUE — work top-to-bottom; promote unblockers per protocol

- [x] **P0 — services-profile compile hang: exponential narrowing re-entry.** DONE
  (round 385, 349dc97b + 40d33b58): the predicted re-entry exponential, with a twist —
  `parseType()`'s AssertsKeyword branch ERASES `asserts x is T` to bare `T`
  (`TypePredicate.assertsModifier` is never constructed), so ALL the exponential
  callee-resolution work concluded "not a predicate" every time (assert narrowing has
  been inert since round 43 → M1.5). Fix mirrors tsc checker.ts: arg-path pre-check
  before any callee resolution; per-outermost-request callee-decl memo
  (`narrowWalkDeclCache`, tsc `links.effectsSignature`); per-invocation flow-node memo
  (tsc `sharedFlowNodes`) with the `depth <= cachedDepth` serve rule + clean-only
  stores (byte-identical to pre-fix truncation semantics); live-depth (2000, tsc
  `flowDepth`) + 1M cumulative-visit budgets shared across re-entries via the
  `narrowLiveDepth` field. services: hang → 563 s / 7,173 errors; compiler profile
  byte-identical 4,484 at −35.8% compile time; server + harness first baselines landed
  (M0.2 now 8/8). AssertNarrowingScalingTest pins the invariant (N=120 of the exact
  re-entry shape ≈2^120 visits pre-fix → 0.125 s; controls prove `x is T` narrowing
  still applies). See the round-385 session note + CLAUDE.md gotchas for the budget
  sizing lesson (50k truncated a legitimate walk and grew the dashboard by one FP).

**M0 — Real-world measurement rig**

- [x] **M0.1 Project-corpus runner.** DONE (9b5bcd78): `--project` profiles in
  `bench-compile-tsc.sh` — compiler/tsc/jsTyping/deprecatedCompat/typingsInstallerCore/
  services/server/harness (each = named dir + transitive tsconfig-references closure,
  flattened) or `all`/comma-list; per-project TSVs (`self-compile-<name>.tsv`,
  compiler keeps the historical `self-compile-tsc.tsv`); per-project log subdirs +
  multi-project overview table.
- [x] **M0.2 Crash/robustness gate.** DONE (round 384; completed 8/8 in round 385) —
  the gate ran and did its job: round 384 got 5/8 profiles green with tightly-clustered
  baselines (compiler 13,245 err / 298 s; tsc-cli 13,247 / 297 s; jsTyping 13,301 /
  304 s; deprecatedCompat 13,256 / 296 s; typingsInstallerCore 13,348 / 292 s — TS2305
  dominating pre-M1.1; rows in bench/*.tsv), zero exceptions/OOMs; **services HUNG →
  became the P0** (killed after 30+ CPU-min frozen in one statement). Round 385 (P0
  fixed) completed the remaining baselines: services 563 s / 7,173 err / 1,226 MB;
  server 627 s / 7,634 err / 1,139 MB; harness 593 s / 8,164 err / 1,920 MB — all
  files emitted, zero crashes anywhere; same FP families across profiles
  (TS2339/TS7006/TS2345/TS2322 ≈ 85% of every profile's count). Also caught an M0.1
  bug: the src/tsc profile logged into the compiler profile's historical TSV — fixed
  (fabca29d, self-compile-tsc-cli.tsv).
- [x] **M0.3 Fix ProjectCompiler dynamic-import specifier extraction.** DONE
  (f85cc438): the parser records specifiers at the real parse sites into
  `SourceFile.moduleSpecifiers` (tsc's `SourceFile.imports`) — static import/export-from,
  import-equals require, dynamic `import()`/`require()` string-literal calls at any
  depth, `import("...")` types, triple-slash path/types from leading trivia;
  `extractSpecifiers` parses instead of regex-scanning. 6 local tests
  (ModuleSpecifierExtractionTest). Known FN: JSDoc `@type {import("x")}` in .js (no
  structural JSDoc model) — revisit with M4.

**M1 — Kill the systematic FP families**

- [x] **M1.1 TS2305 export-star barrel following.** DONE (8a4ba245): measured
  **13,245 → 4,484 self-compile errors (−8,761, −66%)**, TS2305 gone from the top-codes
  list, compile −2.7% for free. `getModuleExportsFollowingStars` (cycle-guarded,
  depth-bounded, memoized per top-level file; NULL = unknowable → callers skip absence
  emission for non-default names — FN-safe) wired into TS2305/2459/2460/2614/2724 +
  TS2613's upgrade; `export * as ns` contributes its name; re-export branch gained the
  import branch's `.js`→`.ts` fallback; `getModuleAllExports` deleted. 8 local tests.
  Suite 8,856 / 0 / 3, zero regressions.
- [x] **M1.2 TS2563 per-container CFA rule.** RESOLVED in three parts. **M1.2a
  (round 385, 3c4cb60b)**: TS2454 respects the CFA bail (`cfaTooLargeFiles` +
  end-of-init filter; CfaTooLargeBailTest). **M1.2b (round 386)**: NARROW_MAX_DEPTH
  50→2000, aligned with tsc's `flowDepth` guard — the decision experiment measured
  ZERO corpus churn (8,861/0/3) and a **−63% self-compile time** (185.8→68.3 s, RSS
  −325 MB): the 50-cap truncated most deep walks, and truncated subtrees are never
  memo-stored, so the cap itself caused the recomputation storm. Deeper walks also
  complete 2 more narrowings that an arg-check consumer turns into TS2345 FPs
  (utilities.ts:11604/11859 — tracked under M1.4). **The TS2563-EMISSION half is
  FOLDED into M3.4** (measured, not assumed): tsc fires TS2563 on largeControlFlowGraph
  because checking each `data[0] = 0` statement walks the evolving array's flow AT THE
  USE SITE — flow-based reference typing, exactly the M3.4 capability; none of our four
  narrowing consumers ever walks that file deep, so faithful walk-exhaustion emission
  is impossible until then. Until M3.4, B399's per-file node-count heuristic stays
  (its 27 self-compile TS2563 FPs remain on the dashboard).
- [x] **M1.5 Activate `asserts` predicates end-to-end.** DONE (round 386, eaa27a90):
  parser builds `TypePredicate(assertsModifier=true)` (`asserts x [is T]` /
  `asserts this`); asserts returns resolve to VOID (getTypeFromTypeNode /
  getTypeNodeName / resolveSimpleTypeName — a return-less bodied assert fn draws no
  TS2355/TS2366/TS7030); `narrowByAssertCall` live for the first time — `is T` target
  narrowing, `is NonNullable<T>` as nullish exclusion, bare `asserts cond` via
  `applyConditionNarrowing` (the `Debug.assert(x !== undefined)` shape); the round-385
  pre-check widened to path-containment (`argMentionsReferencePath`, iterative,
  bails open) per the firewall gotcha; `resolveFlowCalleeDecl` resolves namespace-member
  callees (`Debug.assert` — receiver types as `any`, so property-method resolution
  missed it); `callHasTypeGuardArg` gates `!assertsModifier`. 8 local tests
  (AssertsPredicateActivationTest) with negative controls. Suite 8,869 / 0 / 3.
- [x] **M1.5b Assert narrowing "inert on self-compile" — PREMISE FALSIFIED by test
  (round 386).** A ProjectCompiler repro (AssertsBarrelResolutionTest: namespace
  assert imported through an `export * from` barrel, exactly tsc's
  `_namespaces/ts.ts` topology) narrows CORRECTLY — barrel/alias resolution was
  never the blocker; the 3 tests now pin it. The real reason the M1.5 delta was
  small: sampling the actual TS18048 FPs showed they are ASSIGNMENT-narrowing
  shapes, not assert shapes (`context.pragmas = new Map() as PragmaMap;` then use;
  `result.extendedSourceFiles ??= new Set()`). Addressed the same round:
  **assignment-effect narrowing** — the walkers' shared `narrowByAssignmentRhs`
  adds non-nullish-structural-RHS exclusion (new X / object, array literal / fn
  expr / class expr / template / non-nullish literal, through value-preserving
  wrappers) for `=` and `??=`/`||=` on identifier AND property-path targets
  (`&&=` deliberately excluded — a nullish LHS survives it), with cheap pre-gates
  before any path-string building; Flow.kt binds FlowAssignment for COMPOUND
  assigns on property LHS (plain `=` property targets already had nodes — a
  stale walker comment claiming otherwise cost a first-cut duplicate `when` arm
  that shadowed the real one, dropped the LHS read-records, and regressed
  this-before-super + instanceof narrowing until the suite gate caught it).
  `flowAssignmentTargetsName` (TS2454-shared) untouched. 7 local tests
  (FlowAssignmentNarrowingTest) + per-family bench delta in the session note.
- [x] **M1.3 `types` / `typeRoots` / `@types` resolution.** DONE (round 387,
  473cc0d0 + eed2b73c): ProjectCompiler acquires type libraries like tsc — effective
  roots = `typeRoots` (config-dir-relative) when specified, else every
  `<ancestor>/node_modules/@types` walking up from the config dir; included set =
  `types` when specified (an EMPTY list disables acquisition — the null-vs-empty
  distinction is load-bearing, see the new CLAUDE.md gotcha), else auto-discovery of
  existing packages (scope dirs expand to their subdirectories, dot-dirs skipped);
  entries resolve package.json `types`/`typings` → `index.d.ts`
  (`ModuleResolver.resolveTypeRootPackage`, DefinitelyTyped `scope__name` mangling
  probed for scoped requests) and SEED the import-graph walk (their own imports +
  `/// <reference types>` directives follow); an explicitly requested name that
  resolves nowhere reports TS2688 (byte-exact tsc message). 9 local tests
  (TypesAcquisitionTest) pin inclusion AND exclusion via ambient-global-only packages
  (reachable only through acquisition). Bench gained `--node-stub` (minimal any-typed
  @types/node; toggles without --fresh; rows auto-labeled "+node-stub"). Self-compile:
  no-stub control EXACTLY 4,456 (acquisition inert under `types: []`); with stub
  4,456 → 4,411 (TS2591 43→0, TS2304 3→0, TS2552 4→5 — the 46 resolved names free the
  global 10-lookup suggestion budget so all 5 SetIterator/MapIterator sites carry
  suggestions; ZERO new codes). No-stub stays the honest dashboard default until
  network provides real @types/node.
- [x] **M1.4 Re-measure + strategic map.** DONE (round 387) — full `--listAll`
  family analysis of the compiler profile (4,411 sites bucketed by code × file ×
  message shape × source line) + fresh services/server/harness rows; the map and
  per-family numbers are in the round-387 session note; the top-3 re-ranked
  families are M1.6–M1.8 below (plus two absorbed observations: the
  TS2339-on-union-receiver predicate-narrowing family ~460 sites → noted in M3.4;
  `SetIterator`/`MapIterator`/`RegExp`-replace-overload lib gaps → M2 markers).
- [ ] **M1.6 Contextual typing of object-literal fn-valued members (the TS7006
  kill: ~1,285 of 1,554 = 29% of ALL remaining).** A fn-expr/arrow VALUE of an
  object-literal member must get its param types (and TS7006 suppression) from the
  literal's CONTEXTUAL type's matching member fn-type. The contextual type comes
  from (a) a var-decl annotation — `const table: VisitEachChildTable = {...}`,
  visitorPublic.ts ×810, whose keys are COMPUTED `[SyntaxKind.X]` enum keys against
  a MAPPED-type table (needs computed-key member lookup + mapped-member fn-type
  resolution); (b) the enclosing function's RETURN annotation — the factory pattern
  `function createX(): TypeChecker { return { isUndefinedSymbol: symbol => … } }`,
  checker.ts ×318 + program.ts ×94 + tsbuildPublic.ts ×63; (c) a call-arg's param
  type (partially exists). Infra to build on: `applyContextualParamTypesForArrow`,
  `lookupPropertyTypeForCtx` (B475), `walkObjectLiteralMemberBody`'s ctx plumbing.
  This is the first M3.2 increment, pulled into M1 because it is HALF the remaining
  count; stage it (b)-first (interface member lookup only), then (a) (mapped tables).
- [ ] **M1.7 Two bounded engine bugs, 3-digit combined count.** (a) `undefined`
  FAILS assignability to a union CONTAINING undefined: `Argument of type 'undefined'
  is not assignable to parameter of type 'PunctuationToken<any> | undefined'` —
  TS2345 ×65 (factory `/*questionToken*/ undefined` args) + the same shape as
  TS2322 ×~35 (`undefined` → `VisitResult<Node | undefined>`); find where the
  union's undefined member is lost (likely generic-member resolution poisoning the
  union before the relation). (b) `const m = new Map<K, V>()` types the local as
  the CONSTRUCTOR interface, so every `m.get/set` is TS2339 "does not exist on type
  'MapConstructor'" (×44, e.g. performance.ts module-scope consts) —
  `getReturnTypeOfNewExpression` must instantiate the lib INSTANCE interface for an
  explicit-type-arg lib `new`.
- [ ] **M1.8 TS7030/TS2366 gate audit vs tsc's exact rule (TS7030 ×114).** tsc
  (`checkAllCodePathsInNonVoidFunctionReturnOrThrow`): TS7030 fires ONLY under
  `noImplicitReturns`; TS2366 under `strictNullChecks` when the declared return
  type does NOT include undefined; a return type INCLUDING undefined draws NOTHING
  on implicit fall-through. Our gate (`strictNullChecks || noImplicitReturns` with
  the "nullable" classification) over-fires on `T | undefined` returns under
  strict-only (the bench tsconfig sets strict but not noImplicitReturns —
  emitter.ts:453 `): T | undefined {` is a representative FP). Corpus-gated: audit
  which corpus baselines actually pin the current disjunct before aligning.

**M2 — Real-lib migration (staged; decompose further at start)**

- [ ] **M2.1 Lib graph loader.** Parse + bind the real `typescript-repo/src/lib/*.d.ts`
  selected per `target`/`lib` (the `/// <reference lib="…" />` DAG: lib.es2020 →
  es2019 + es2020.* pieces), as a process-wide immutable snapshot parsed ONCE and
  shared across programs (this snapshot is deliberately the seed of M5's incremental
  infra). Behind a CompilerOptions flag so corpus A/B comparison is possible.
- [ ] **M2.2 Corpus A/B and default flip.** Run the corpus with real libs; burn down
  the diff (baselines were produced by real-lib tsc, so divergence generally means one
  of our compensating hardcodes — fix by deletion). Flip the default when green.
- [ ] **M2.3 Unwind lib-divergence pins.** Grep anchors: `LIB_MIN_TARGET`,
  `LIB_MIN_TARGET_SOFT`, `BUILTIN_LIB_VALUE_INTERFACES`, `KNOWN_GLOBALS` (derive from
  the loaded libs), the hardcoded Date TS2740 message, hardcoded "and N more" counts,
  hardcoded overload chains copied from baselines (`WEAKSET_2769_CHAIN` etc.),
  `libFeatureAvailable`. Delete `BUILTIN_LIB_SOURCE` last.
- [ ] **M2.4 DOM libs as an opt-in set** (dom.generated.d.ts is 1 MB+ — measure the
  parse/bind cost; ties into the shared-snapshot design).

**M3 — Type-engine completion, conformance-driven (the long pole; each item
decomposes into a multi-session campaign — read PLAN-PHASE-4.md § "Known architectural
blockers" for accumulated detail before starting)**

- [ ] **M3.0 Conformance generator extension.** Extend `generateTypeScriptTests` with
  a per-category allowlist for `tests/cases/conformance/` (5,907 files; keep all tsgo
  set-B filters). Start with the categories matching M3.1 (types/typeParameters,
  types/typeRelationships, expressions/functions). Each category lands only when its
  failures are triaged into queue items — never leave a category half-red without notes.
- [ ] **M3.1 Generic instantiation + call-site inference** (remove the
  `hasUnresolvedTypeParams` relation bail; real type-argument inference incl.
  contextual return positions). This is the documented #1 engine blocker.
- [ ] **M3.2 Contextual typing engine** (parameters, returns, object/array literals,
  generic-context propagation — replaces `applyContextualParamTypesForArrow`-era
  special cases).
- [ ] **M3.3 Mapped / conditional / template-literal / indexed-access evaluation**
  (replace the AST-shape walkers; delete the superseded dedicated walkers and pins).
- [ ] **M3.4 Flow narrowing unified into identifier typing** (`getTypeOfIdentifier`
  consults the flow graph; retire the per-consumer narrowing carve-outs). **Absorbed
  from M1.2 (round 386): faithful TS2563 walk-exhaustion emission** — tsc fires it
  when USE-SITE reference typing walks a >2000-relevant-node flow (largeControlFlowGraph
  = 10k evolving-array mutations, each `data[0] = 0` check walks `data`'s flow), which
  requires exactly this item's flow-based identifier typing; then delete B399's
  per-file node-count heuristic + its `cfaTooLargeFiles` TS2454 filter pairing and the
  27 self-compile TS2563 FPs. tsc-shaped budget consumption (linear single-antecedent
  steps free via the iterative `while(true)` loop; only branch/condition recursion
  consumes `flowDepth`) belongs to the same rebuild. **Absorbed from M1.4 (round 387):
  the self-compile TS2339 family's dominant bucket (461 union-receiver sites + the
  named `Type`/tuple ones) is user-type-guard narrowing feeding MEMBER ACCESS on tsc's
  big AST-node unions (`isTypeParameterDeclaration(node) ? …node.name… : …` on
  `HasModifiers`; `isGenericTupleType(type) && type.target.…`) — the narrowing
  consumers exist, but predicate-filtering 40-member merged-interface unions (and
  ternary-position narrowing) under-resolves; measure per-consumer before rebuilding.**
- [ ] **M3.5 Per-file scopes** (Blocker #3: stop merging all file locals into
  `globals`; per-file scope construction with explicit import visibility).

**M4 — Ecosystem completeness (interleaves with late M3)**

- [ ] **M4.1 Full nodenext resolution**: package.json `exports`/`imports` maps,
  symlink/realpath (pnpm layouts), `typesVersions`, package self-references.
- [ ] **M4.2 Real declaration emitter.** `.d.ts` output for arbitrary code (the corpus
  strips most `.d.ts` sections, so almost none exists today; `declaration: true` is
  table stakes for "any project"). Test bed: conformance decl baselines + self-compile
  d.ts diffing.
- [ ] **M4.3 JSX end-to-end** (`jsx: react-jsx`/`react`/`preserve` transforms on real
  React-shaped code).
- [ ] **M4.4 External sourcemaps** (`.js.map` files; inline maps exist).
- [ ] **M4.5 Decision point**: project references / composite / incremental scope
  (tsgo supports them; needed for large monorepos — decide build vs defer with owner).

**M5 — Performance (starts only when the project corpus compiles clean)**

- [ ] **M5.1 Profiling grid**: JFR/async-profiler over the project corpus (cold CLI,
  warm in-process via BenchMain, RSS); publish flamegraph findings in a session note
  before optimizing anything.
- [ ] **M5.2 Allocation discipline in the relation engine** (type interning /
  canonicalization — replace the documented fresh-mint caps like the
  `getPropertyTypeForRelation` depth bound with proper sharing).
- [ ] **M5.3 Cache effectiveness under scope contexts** (today `nodeTypes` is bypassed
  whenever any resolution context is active = recompute on every generic-heavy path).
- [ ] **M5.4 Parallel per-file checking** via the existing-but-unused `CheckerPool`
  (LinkStore side-tables already keep binder output immutable for this).
- [ ] **M5.5 Incremental compilation** (`.tsbuildinfo`-style reuse; the M2.1 shared
  lib snapshot is the first piece).
- [ ] **M5.6 Native target re-enable + tune** (linuxX64 was disabled in c7e3535f;
  native already wins <10 kLOC — fix the big-input inversion, likely GC/allocation).
- [ ] **M5.7 Numeric targets** (proposed; confirm with owner at M5 start): warm ≥ tsc
  throughput on 500k-LOC real code; cold CLI ≤ 1.5× tsc on medium projects; RSS ≤ tsc;
  stretch: approach tsgo on native.

### Offline asset inventory (verified 2026-07-02)

- `typescript-repo` object DB is complete (sparse checkout, full objects): any
  `src/**` path extractable via `git archive HEAD <path>`; `src/lib/` holds the 110
  real lib `.d.ts` files; `tests/cases/conformance/` holds 5,907 `.ts`/`.tsx` cases.
- Node/tsc/tsgo are NOT currently installed — differential testing (M0 optional) and
  real `@types/node` (M1.3) wait for network.
- The benchmark project cache lives under `build/bench/` (cheap to rebuild); results
  TSVs under `bench/` (gitignored, machine-specific).

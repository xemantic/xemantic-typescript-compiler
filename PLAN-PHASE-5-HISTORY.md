# PLAN-PHASE-5 session-note history

Archived Phase-17 session notes trimmed from PLAN-PHASE-5.md (most recent first). See PLAN-PHASE-5.md for the live queue + the ~10 most-recent notes.

**Round 384 (continued) — M0.2 findings + M1.1 landed: self-compile 13,245 → 4,484 (−66%).**
M0.2 (`--project all`): 5/8 profiles green in ~5 min each with tightly clustered
baselines (compiler 13,245; tsc-cli 13,247; jsTyping 13,301; deprecatedCompat 13,256;
typingsInstallerCore 13,348 — TS2305 dominating each at 8,752–8,837), zero
exceptions/OOMs; **services HUNG → the P0 now at the queue top** (30+ CPU-min frozen in
one `checkVarDeclAssignability`; stack: `narrowByAssertCall` → callee/arg type
resolution → `getNarrowedTypeForReference` re-entry per assert-call flow node, no
memoization — tsc's services code is `Debug.assert`-dense); server/harness deferred.
Also caught: the src/tsc profile's TSV name collided with the compiler profile's
historical file (fixed, `self-compile-tsc-cli.tsv`). **M1.1** (8a4ba245): export-star
barrel following — measured **13,245 → 4,484 (−8,761)**, TS2305 eliminated from the
top codes, compile −2.7%; remaining top families now TS7006×1554 (contextual-typing
gaps → M3.2), TS2339×886, TS2322×827, TS2345×543, TS7030×114, TS2769×77. **M1.2 recon**
(for the P0 + M1.2 implementer): tsc's mechanism confirmed at checker.ts:29037 —
`flowDepth === 2000` counts recursive `getTypeAtFlowNode` invocations per
`getFlowTypeOfReference` walk (linear single-antecedent steps are the iterative
`while(true)` loop and don't consume budget; `sharedFlowNodes` memoizes shared nodes
per walk), `flowAnalysisDisabled` is checker-global but save/restored around each
function-or-module block in `checkBlock` (= container-scoped), and
`reportFlowControlError` anchors at `findAncestor(reference, isFunctionOrModuleBlock)
.statements.pos` token span. Our B399 per-file node-count heuristic must be replaced by
that walk-budget + per-walk memoization — which is ALSO the P0 fix.

**Round 384 (2026-07-03) — M0.1 + M0.3 landed; M0.2 baseline running.**
M0.1 (9b5bcd78): `--project` profiles + per-project TSVs in the bench script (see QUEUE
entry). M0.3 (f85cc438): parse-based specifier extraction — the parser now records
`SourceFile.moduleSpecifiers` at the real parse sites (static/dynamic/require/import-type
plus a new bounded leading-trivia scan for `/// <reference>` that honors directives after
a block-comment header, which `checkTripleSlashSelfReference`'s corpus-pinned scan does
not); `ProjectCompiler.extractSpecifiers` parses instead of regex-scanning, so
string-literal/comment/regex-literal text can no longer fabricate unresolved imports or
pull junk files into the program. 6 local tests pin the invariant (garbage never
extracted; deep-nested dynamic imports found; string-literal mention neither reaches
`unresolved` nor joins the program). Suite 8,848 / 0 / 3 (+6 local). Session ops notes:
a leftover bench run from round 383 was still executing at session start (its TSV row
landed at 23:08 — labels tell them apart); my first services verification run was killed
as polluted (its gradle step compiled pre-M0.3 code, then the M0.3 recompile swapped
class files under the running JVM — don't recompile while a bench JVM is up). M0.2
`--project all` relaunched clean on f85cc438; expected effect on compiler profile:
errors stay exactly 13,245 (extraction doesn't affect checking), unresolved drops from
120 to just node-builtin bare specifiers (env-legit until M1.3).

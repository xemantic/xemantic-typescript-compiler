# Inversion ambient ledger — (INV.0) Stage 0 extractions

One row per extraction out of `Checker.kt` (owner directive 2026-09-02; the
contract is `docs/INVERSION-DESIGN.md` § 10). The columns that matter are the
AMBIENT ones: which checker fields the extracted collaborator still READS and
WRITES after the move — the census of what must become explicit for every
later inversion stage. "none" is the target state; a non-none row is a debt
the next stage must either pay or justify.

| # | Collaborator | Extracted from | Ambient reads | Ambient writes | Lines moved | Receipts |

| 1 | `TypeInterner` (`TypeInterner.kt`) — canonical type identity: `Type.Reference` / `Type.Union` / `Type.Intersection` interning (INV.5(a), design § 4 pillar 4) | `getOrInternReference`, `internUnion`, `getIntersectionType`'s intern tail + the six intern-cache maps of `CheckerState` | **none** — owns its six maps; every input is a parameter | **none** | ~60 | (P18.5) session note: corpus suite green, cost_gate +0.00%, ab-interleaved, JFR alloc profile, PrintInlining, core compile time |

## Notes per row

### 1 — TypeInterner

The six maps moved wholesale (`referenceCache`/`unionInternCache`/
`intersectionInternCache` + their packed-Long `M0.3(iii)` fast-path twins);
their only three access sites in `Checker.kt` became one-line delegations
(`getOrInternReference` → `reference`, `internUnion` → `union`, the
`getIntersectionType` tail → `intersection`). Normalization stays with the
callers — the interner is identity ONLY, which is what makes its ambient
surface empty. Constructed once per `Checker` inside `CheckerState`
(lifetime-coupled: `Type.id`s are a per-checker, per-thread sequence,
INV.6(6c0), so a longer-lived interner would conflate types by id collision).

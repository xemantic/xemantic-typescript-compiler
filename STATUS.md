**(INC.46)(3) — PROJECT-WIDE DIAGNOSTICS ARE INCREMENTAL, AND WITH (INC.44)/(INC.45)
NOTHING AN EDITOR ASKS IS WHOLE-PROGRAM BY DEFAULT ANY MORE (2026-08-29).**
`Project.diagnostics()` no longer rebuilds after every edit: when the edit moved no
exported signature it answers the previous build's rows with the edited files' rows
replaced, from ONE narrowed build — **108-113 ms against 4,864-5,096 ms, a factor of 45**
on a served edit. **GRADED AS A DIFFERENTIAL THAT NEEDS NO BASELINE**: over (INC.46)(2)'s
40 real tsc commits, edited THROUGH THE OVERLAY as an editor's unsaved buffers, the answer
must equal a project opened fresh on the edited text — **EQUIVALENT, 40 agreed of 40**,
with `served=27` as the control that keeps the agreement from being vacuous (a run whose
`served` is 0 is REFUSED — round 790: a verifier reads 0 both when the skip is sound and
when the instrument is dead). The 27 is exactly step (2)'s 67%, two instruments
corroborating. **Five preconditions, each CHECKED rather than argued** and each with its
own pin; the pin set is a PAIR by construction (a body-only edit must be served and a
signature edit must not — an implementation that always serves passes the first, one that
never serves passes the second), and each is pinned twice, on the ANSWER and on the
BUILD COUNT, because without the cost family every pin passes against the old
always-rebuild behaviour. **TWO DEFECTS THE PINS FOUND THAT REVIEW DID NOT**: the
incremental answer was NOT RETAINED (`cached` cannot hold it — that field is a
whole-program `Result` — so a second `diagnostics()` with no intervening edit rebuilt, and
an editor asks twice constantly); and **the build-counting unit every cost pin in this repo
uses is BLIND for an edited config** — an overlaid file is served from the overlay and
never reaches the backing `Vfs`, so the config's read count stops moving and "did this
rebuild" reads 0 for a build that certainly happened. Two pre-existing control pins
legitimately moved 1 -> 2 builds and were updated to state the new cost model rather than
papered over: adding an export IS a signature change, and the gate being wrong costs the
narrowed build plus the rebuild. **GATES.** Suite **16,464 / 0 / 3** (+11, exactly the new
pins); `cost_gate.py` exit 0; `huge_methods.py --fail-over 0` clean; build warning-clean.
**THE SUCCESSOR IS SCC-AWARE HASHING**: `types.ts` still escapes on an in-file
strongly-connected component that no budget closes (measured at 2 M and 12 M nodes) and it
accounts for 8 of the 13 fallbacks, so Tarjan-per-component is the one lever between the
measured **67%** floor and the **87.5%** ceiling.

**(INC.46)(2) — THE STABILITY RATE IS **67%** OVER 40 REAL tsc COMMITS, AND ONE TEXT SCAN
WAS WORTH 35 POINTS OF IT (2026-08-29).** Step (2) is the one the queue said could refuse the
whole mechanism ("under ~70% the 45x is diluted to nothing"). `scripts/inc46-stability.sh`
fetches its OWN blob-filtered depth-3000 clone of microsoft/TypeScript — never
`typescript-repo`, which is a depth-1 shallow clone AND a build-pinned input — and replays
**40 real no-merge commits** touching `src/compiler`, materialising the WHOLE tree at the
parent against the whole tree at the commit (a file from another era beside a tree from this
one resolves against symbols that may not exist). **27 of 40 stable = 67%**, and **8 of the
13 that moved did so ONLY because `types.ts` escapes** — so the band is a **67% floor and an
87.5% ceiling** with one named lever between them. **THE FIRST READING WAS 32% AND WAS AN
ARTIFACT OF MY OWN CODE**: `declaresGlobalSurface` scanned whole source for
`export as namespace` — a construct with NO AST NODE in this parser — and `checker.ts` says
those words **twice, both in `//` comments**; since it is the file tsc's history edits most,
that single false positive cost **35 percentage points** and presented as a plausible
refusal rather than as a defect. **No fixture would have found it** — nobody writes
`// export as namespace foo` into a hand-written test — and the edit corpus found it in one
run. **`types.ts`'s escape is STRUCTURAL and was measured rather than assumed**: it is a
node-budget stop at 2,000,000 nodes (129.6 ms) AND still a stop at **12,000,000 (741 ms,
whole budget burned)**, because the file-boundary cut cannot help INSIDE a file and
`types.ts` declares ~874 mutually recursive interfaces in one. The lever is **SCC-aware
hashing**, deliberately not attempted here; the budget stays bounded and the file is recorded
in `ExportSignatures.whole` — a full rebuild, never a stale diagnostic. **GATES.** Suite
**16,453 / 0 / 3** (+13 over 16,440: the 12 step-(1) pins plus the comment-mention pin this
defect earned); `cost_gate.py` exit 0; `huge_methods.py --fail-over 0` clean. Step (3),
wiring the invalidation into `Project.diagnostics()`, is now the only item left.

**(INC.46)(1) — THE EXPORTED-SIGNATURE FINGERPRINT IS BUILT AND MEASURED, AND ITS WALK
HAD TO BE FOUND BY MEASUREMENT THREE TIMES (2026-08-29).** The queue's step-(1) threshold
("single-digit ms on `types.ts`'s 874 exports, or stop") is met with room: **136 ms
whole-program** on a 5,215 ms rebuild, and **0 ms on 23 of 24 narrowed builds** — a
narrowed build fingerprints only its partition, so the per-EDIT cost of the gate is under
a millisecond against the 108-113 ms build it rides on. **The two controls that decide
feasibility are not cost figures**: two builds of identical text agree **78/78** (the
id-freedom claim — a hash carrying a `Type.id` passes every structural test and then
invalidates everything, always), and a narrowed build's fingerprint equals the
whole-program one **24/24** (the CONVERGENCE claim — the baseline comes from a
whole-program build and the edit's answer from a narrowed one, so a systematic
disagreement means every first edit falls back forever). **THE WALK'S SHAPE WAS THE REAL
QUESTION.** A path-only cycle guard is EXPONENTIAL in DAG width — 159 s inside one build,
found by an external `jcmd Thread.print` — and closed-subtree memoization is still not
enough, because tsc's resolved-type graph is one giant SCC (`Node.parent: Node` plus
hundreds of mutually recursive interfaces): **6 of 78 files unfinished inside a
2,000,000-node budget, among them `checker.ts`, `binder.ts` and `emitter.ts`**. What works
is CUTTING at the file boundary — a type declared elsewhere is unchanged by construction
while only this file is edited, so it is keyed by its declaration's `(fileName, pos, end)`
and not descended into. That took the arm from 719 ms / 6 escapes / **4-of-24** agreement
to **136 ms / 2 escapes / 24-of-24**. **AND THE QUEUE CENSUSED THE WRONG QUANTITY**: cost
tracks the transitive type CLOSURE, not the export COUNT, and the two are near-inversely
related — `utilities.ts`'s 692 exports are 1.6 ms where `types.ts`, which declares the
SCC, is 129.6 ms. Steps (2) (the stability RATE, which needs a deepened TypeScript clone)
and (3) (wiring the invalidation) are deliberately NOT in this commit — the order of work
is measure-first and (2) can still refuse the whole thing. **GATES.** Suite **16,452 / 0 /
3** (+12 over 16,440, exactly the new pins); `cost_gate.py` exit 0 with a largest move of
**+0.08%** (the profile's standing residual — the expected answer, since the walk is off
by default and a strict no-op then); `huge_methods.py --fail-over 0` **0 over limit**.

**(INC.46) QUEUED AND PRICED — AND MEASURING IT REFUTED THE QUEUE'S OWN EXPLANATION OF WHY
PROJECT-WIDE DIAGNOSTICS CANNOT BE INCREMENTAL (2026-08-29, owner's idea).** The standing
story, from round 772 and (INC.35), is that a dependency closure buys nothing on tsc because
its sources are `export *` barrels. **The barrels were never the cause.** A SYMBOL-level use
graph — which is free, since `capturedDefinitions` already records span -> declaration —
re-checks **100% of the program's characters at the median edit, the same as the file-level
graph** (94.9% of imported names placed, so not an under-count): those files genuinely use
symbols from most other files and the relation is transitive. **What collapses it is asking
whether an edit moved any EXPORTED SIGNATURE**, not which symbols a file uses: a body-only
edit moves none, so no dependent re-checks and the cost is one narrowed build — **108-113 ms
against 4,864-5,096 ms, a factor of 45**, already measured by (INC.31)/(INC.37). **91.6% of
the program's characters are inside brace bodies** (a proxy for edit POSITION, optimistic
because an inferred return type leaks, pessimistic because it counts `interface` bodies).
**This needs no corpus and no owner call** — a signature hash pays on DENSE code too, so
unlike (INC.35) it is gradable on the dashboard profile. **THE SHARP HAZARD IS RECORDED**:
`typeToString` is the wrong hash source in BOTH directions — `aliasDisplayMap` is a
first-wins global so it is not a pure function of the type (spurious invalidation), and B58.1
renders `errorType` as `"any"` so a degraded resolution hashes as a genuine `any` (a MISSED
invalidation, silently). The hash must be an id-free structural fingerprint; (INC.16) already
built one to copy. Cost input censused: **3,398 exported declarations, mean 44/file, max 874
in `types.ts`**; its runtime is the first thing to measure, with a stated refusal threshold.
**No code landed — the entry is the deliverable.**

**(INC.45) — `renameAt` IS NARROWED TOO, AND ITS ABLATION FOUND A BLIND PIN SET
(2026-08-29).** The rename sweep took (INC.44)'s spelling closure and hands the resulting
file set to the compiler as a check partition. Two things make it more than a copy.
**Both of a rename's builds must share ONE partition** — `verifyRename` compares
diagnostics as a `(file, code)` MULTISET, which a partition filters, so a narrowed
"before" against a whole-program "after" reports every unswept row as removed; the
soundness argument for narrowing it at all is that a rename edits only files the plan
names and an unedited file's meaning can change only through a name it imports, which it
must then SPELL. **And the population is the closure UNION every occurrence of the NEW
name**, because `verifyRename`'s third check — the only one that can see a rename which
compiles and means something else — scans for occurrences already spelling it and would
otherwise pass VACUOUSLY. **THE ABLATION'S FINDING**: arm b2 (the after-build forgets the
partition) reddened **NOTHING**, because every fixture was a CLEAN program and both bags
were empty whatever either build walked — one file carrying a diagnostic and spelling
neither name takes it to **2 RED**. Arm b3 (never narrow) is **UNDISCRIMINATED and
recorded as such**: the change is equivalence-preserving by construction, so what stands
in its place is one pin on the shipped DEFAULT with no mode install in it ((INC.16)'s
lesson). **MEASURED**: an ordinary rename is **~1.0-1.3 s against ~15 s (12-14.5x)** —
`emitFiles` 2 of 78 files at 1,304 ms, `transformNodes` 3 of 78 at 1,025,
`checkSourceElement` 1 of 78 (but that file is `checker.ts`) at 4,725.
**GATES.** Suite **16,440 / 0 / 3** (+18 over the session's 16,422 baseline, exactly the new pins); rename differential **EQUIVALENT** — 8 carets,
7 narrowed, 6 producing an APPLICABLE plan, 1,691 edits compared plan for plan, 0
diverged, 56.5 s against 114.2 s; three ablation arms b1 **1 RED** / b2 **2 RED** / b3
undiscriminated with a reason.

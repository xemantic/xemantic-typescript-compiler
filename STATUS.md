# Status

**Phase 4 — Checker buildout.** ~8,338 / 10,078 tests passing (~83%).

**Surgical pool is exhausted (6+ consecutive sessions confirmed).** Queue
reshuffled 2026-04-25: next sessions should commit to architectural blockers
rather than searching for surgical wins.

**MAINT-1 done 2026-04-25**: 32 stale skip-log entries marked
strikethrough; `find_candidates.py` updated to strip `~~...~~` spans. Net
zero test-count delta (all stale entries already pass). Surgical pool
remains empty after the audit.

**Recommended next sessions (highest absolute yield first):**
1. ~~**MAINT-1**: Stale skip-log audit (~1 session, +5–15 tests).~~ Done.
2. **Blocker #1**: Full control flow narrowing (~2–4 sessions, +60–100 tests).
   - **Step 1 (2026-04-25, 17.1a)**: Flow-graph infrastructure in binder — DONE (no behavior change yet, 0 tests). `Flow.kt` + `FlowGraphBuilder` integrated into `BinderResult.flowGraph`.
   - **Step 2a (2026-04-25, 17.1b, +1)**: First narrowing wire-up — `getNarrowedTypeForReference` walker + var-decl `never` target adoption. Flips `narrowingUnionToNeverAssigment_ts`. Supports `===`/`!==`/`==`/`!=` against literals, `&&`/`||` (De Morgan), FlowBranchLabel joins.
   - **Step 2b (next)**: Broaden emission-site adoption — TS2454 (`getNarrowedType` returns `never` ⇒ "used before assigned" suppressed), TS2339 (narrowed-to-never elaboration), TS2774 (always-defined function in condition), and non-`never` var-decl targets. Also extend narrowing operations: `typeof x === "string"`, `x instanceof Class`, type-predicate function calls.
3. **Blocker #2**: Generic argument inference (~2 sessions, +20–40 tests).
4. **Blocker #3**: Cross-file global scope refactor (~3+ sessions, +30+ tests).

# Status

**Phase 4 — Checker buildout.** ~8,338 / 10,078 tests passing (~83%).

**Surgical pool is exhausted (6+ consecutive sessions confirmed).** Queue
reshuffled 2026-04-25: next sessions should commit to architectural blockers
rather than searching for surgical wins.

**MAINT-1 done 2026-04-25**: 32 stale skip-log entries marked
strikethrough; `find_candidates.py` updated to strip `~~...~~` spans. Net
zero test-count delta (all stale entries already pass). Surgical pool
remains empty after the audit.

**Recommended next sessions (highest absolute yield first):**
1. ~~**MAINT-1**: Stale skip-log audit (~1 session, +5–15 tests).~~ Done.
2. **Blocker #1**: Full control flow narrowing (~2–4 sessions, +60–100 tests).
   - **Step 1 (2026-04-25, 17.1a)**: Flow-graph infrastructure in binder — DONE (no behavior change yet, 0 tests). `Flow.kt` + `FlowGraphBuilder` integrated into `BinderResult.flowGraph`.
   - **Step 2a (2026-04-25, 17.1b, +1)**: First narrowing wire-up — `getNarrowedTypeForReference` walker + var-decl `never` target adoption. Flips `narrowingUnionToNeverAssigment_ts`. Supports `===`/`!==`/`==`/`!=` against literals, `&&`/`||` (De Morgan), FlowBranchLabel joins.
   - **Step 2b (2026-04-25, 17.1c+17.1d, net-zero infra)**: Extended narrowing ops + widened gate. `tryNarrowByTypeOf` handles `typeof x === "string"`; `narrowByInstanceOf` handles `x instanceof Class`. Var-decl gate widened from `never`-only to any primitive-shaped target (Intrinsic / Literal). Both commits net-zero — failing tests with these patterns gate on adjacent infrastructure (type-predicate inference, switch-true case-cond narrowing).
   - **Step 2c-i (2026-04-25, 17.1e, net-zero)**: TS2339 narrowed-to-never wiring in `checkMemberAccessMissing` — when receiver Identifier's `Type.Union` raw type narrows to `never` via flow graph, emit `Property 'X' does not exist on type 'never'.`. Uses `getTypeOfExpression` so works for function-local identifiers, not just file-globals. Companion fix: `narrowByInstanceOf` non-union contradiction now returns `never` (was returning `t`) when source matches class and isMatch=false — mirrors `narrowByTypeOfGuard`'s already-correct shape. Net-zero because failing TS2339-on-never tests (`instanceofWithStructurallyIdenticalTypes_ts`, `typeGuardConstructorDerivedClass_ts`) need additional narrowing operators (type-predicate fns, `x.constructor === Class`).
   - **Step 2c-ii (2026-04-25, 17.1f, net-zero)**: `in` operator narrowing — mirror of typeof/instanceof. New `narrowByInOperator` filters union by `typeHasOwnProperty` (positive: keep "has prop"; negative: keep "doesn't have"). Non-union returns `never` for the `!in` contradiction case. Wired into `applyConditionNarrowing`'s BinaryExpression switch. Net-zero — failing in-narrowing tests (`inKeywordTypeguard_ts`) need additional pieces (in-narrowing wired into TS2339 elaboration on union receivers, primitive-RHS TS2638, unknown-RHS TS18046).
   - **Step 2c (cont, next)**: Remaining wire-ups: TS2454 via flow-graph definite-assignment (replace ad-hoc walker — note 17.1c session warned a snapshot/restore approach regresses -7), TS2774 always-defined-function-in-condition (~9-test test `uncalledFunctionChecksInConditional_ts` is the prime candidate, but needs all-or-nothing match), FlowAssignment-RHS narrowing (medium risk — could over-narrow legitimate union-source TS2322 cases), type-predicate function narrowing (`function isC1(c): c is C1`).
3. **Blocker #2**: Generic argument inference (~2 sessions, +20–40 tests).
4. **Blocker #3**: Cross-file global scope refactor (~3+ sessions, +30+ tests).
